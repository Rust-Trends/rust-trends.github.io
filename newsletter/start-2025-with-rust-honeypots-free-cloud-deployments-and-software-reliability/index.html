Whether you’re setting bold coding goals or just resolving to finally finish that side project (we see you!), we’re thrilled to have you with us for the journey ahead. <p>To kick off 2025, we’ve got a packed issue! Dive into our latest tutorial on building a honeypot in Rust and deploying it to Oracle Cloud for free (cybersecurity just got fun), check out a thought-provoking podcast on software reliability, and explore tips to supercharge your Rust projects this year.<p>P.S. Have a cool Rust project or tip? Hit reply and let us know—your work might just make it into a future issue. Let’s make 2025 a standout year for Rustaceans everywhere! 🚀<h2 id=deep-dive-into-reliability-jon-gjengset-s-take-on-rust-s-role-in-modern-software>Deep Dive into Reliability: Jon Gjengset’s Take on Rust’s Role in Modern Software</h2><p>In a recent episode of the “Compose” podcast, host Tim McNamara interviews Jon Gjengset, author of Rust for Rustaceans, about enhancing software reliability.<p>Gjengset describes software quality as a problem “infinitely deep in all directions,” emphasizing the complexity of achieving reliability.<p>The discussion covers various testing methodologies, including fuzz testing, property testing, and concolic execution, each offering unique benefits in identifying software vulnerabilities.<p>They also explore tools like the Kani model checker and testing frameworks such as Loom and Turmoil, which assist in verifying concurrent Rust code.<p>The conversation extends to the human aspects of software development, highlighting the importance of effective collaboration with stakeholders and the sustainability of open-source projects.<p>Gjengset shares insights on managing dependencies, using the example of serde-yaml, to illustrate the careful consideration required when integrating external libraries.<p>This interview offers valuable perspectives for developers aiming to enhance the reliability of their Rust applications.<p>For a more in-depth understanding, you can listen for the full interview <a href=https://timclicks.dev/podcast/reliable-software-an-interview-with-jon-gjengset target=_blank>here</a>.<h2 id=building-a-honeypot-in-rust-and-deploying-it-to-oracle-cloud-for-free>Building a Honeypot in Rust and Deploying It to Oracle Cloud for Free</h2><p>Honeypots aren’t just for catching bees—they’re a powerful tool in cybersecurity to detect and analyze malicious activity. If you’ve ever wanted to create your own honeypot while diving into some Rust programming, this tutorial is a must-read! In this guide, we’ll show you how to build a honeypot in Rust and deploy it to Oracle Cloud—all without spending a dime.<h3 id=why-rust-for-a-honeypot>Why Rust for a Honeypot?</h3><p>Rust’s reputation for performance and safety makes it an excellent choice for cybersecurity projects. A honeypot needs to handle malicious traffic gracefully (and securely). Rust’s ownership model helps ensure that even in high-stakes situations, your application won’t crash or leak sensitive data.<h3 id=what-s-inside-the-tutorial>What’s Inside the Tutorial?</h3><p>This tutorial breaks the project into digestible steps:<ol><li><p>Crafting the Honeypot: Learn how to create a minimal yet effective honeypot in Rust. The code is beginner-friendly yet robust, making it a great project to sharpen your skills.</p><li><p>Oracle Cloud Deployment: Why pay for hosting when Oracle Cloud offers free compute instances? The tutorial walks you through setting up your cloud environment, configuring your honeypot, and deploying it without headaches.</p><li><p>Practical Tips: From securing your deployment to monitoring traffic, the guide offers actionable advice to ensure your honeypot operates smoothly.</p></ol><h3 id=what-i-loved-about-this-project>What I Loved About This Project</h3><p>Building this honeypot is like solving a fun puzzle—it combines Rust’s technical edge with real-world utility. The choice to use Oracle Cloud’s free tier is brilliant, especially for those of us who love experimenting but are allergic to extra costs.<h3 id=why-you-should-try-it>Why You Should Try It</h3><p>This isn’t just a cool project—it’s an opportunity to level up your Rust skills, learn about cybersecurity, and deploy something tangible to the cloud. Even if you’re a Rust beginner, this guide is detailed enough to get you through. Plus, who doesn’t love a good freebie?<p>Ready to get your hands dirty with some Rust code and cybersecurity magic? <a href=https://rust-trends.com/posts/building-a-honeypot-in-rust-and-deploy-it-to-oracle-for-free/ target=_blank>Check out the full tutorial</a> and let me know what you build! The <a href=https://github.com/Rust-Trends/honeypot target=_blank>github repo</a> can be found here<h2 id=building-safety-with-rust-lessons-from-sonair-s-ultrasonic-sensor-development>Building Safety with Rust: Lessons from Sonair’s Ultrasonic Sensor Development</h2><p>In a recent <a href=https://www.sonair.com/journal/building-for-safety-with-rust target=_blank>article</a>, Sonair’s Head of Software, Espen Albrektsen, delves into the company’s adoption of Rust for developing their 3D ultrasonic sensor. He highlights Rust’s blend of low-level control and high-level features, which enhances both development speed and functional safety.<p>Albrektsen notes that while C and C++ offer speed and flexibility, they come with legacy issues like manual memory management. Rust addresses these challenges by enforcing memory safety and providing a robust type system, leading to more reliable and secure code. He mentions that the team, initially unfamiliar with Rust, quickly became comfortable with its features, stating, <strong>“Almost immediately, we were blown away.”</strong><p>A standout advantage of Rust is its ecosystem of crates—open-source libraries that streamline development. Albrektsen shares an office joke: <strong>“Of course there is a crate for that,”</strong> emphasizing the ease of finding ready-to-use solutions for various needs.<p>Sonair is also pursuing safety certifications like IEC 61508 and SIL2 for their Rust-based applications, aiming to be among the first to deploy a safety-certified Rust implementation.<p>This journey underscores Rust’s growing significance in developing safe, efficient, and reliable embedded systems.<h2 id=snippets>Snippets</h2><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/indiv0/aoc-fastest target=_blank>Solving AoC 2024 in Under 1ms in Rust</a><li><a href=https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-foundation-in-review-2024-annual-report-preview/ target=_blank>2024 in Review: Rust Foundation Annual Report Preview</a></ul><hr><p>We are thrilled to have you as part of our growing community of Rust enthusiasts!
