The Rust community is thriving and has an abundance of informative articles, tutorials, applications, and repositories. However, with so much to choose from, it can be overwhelming. We have handpicked the best of the best for you, so let’s dive in!<p><strong>In today’s email:</strong><ul><li><strong>Connecting the world with Rust</strong><li><strong>Introducing Lapce: a new editor built with the power of Rust</strong><li><strong>The Rust Foundation</strong></ul><h2 id=connecting-the-world-with-rust>Connecting the world with Rust</h2><div class=row><div class=column>Writing your own API (Application Programming Interface) can be a rewarding and challenging task. An API allows you to expose specific functionality of your software to other developers, enabling them to interact with your application in a predictable and standardized way. In this article, we will take a look at what it takes to write your own API in Rust. <p>Before you start writing your API, it is important to think about what you want to achieve with it. Do you want to expose specific functionality of your application to other developers? Do you want to allow other applications to access data stored in your application? Answering these questions will help you determine the scope and functionality of your API.<p>Once you have a clear idea of what you want your API to do, the next step is to choose a framework for building it. There are several popular options for building APIs in Rust, the most popular ones are <a href=https://rocket.rs/ target=_blank>Rocket</a> and <a href=https://actix.rs/ target=_blank>Actix</a>. Each of these frameworks has its own set of features and benefits, so it is worth doing some research to determine which one is the best fit for your needs.<p>Once you have chosen a framework, you can start designing the structure and functionality of your API. This will involve creating endpoints, which are specific points of access for interacting with your API, and defining the input and output of each endpoint. You will also need to consider how you want to handle authentication, error handling, and other important aspects of API development. To learn more see some links below:<ul><li><a href=https://swagger.io/resources/articles/best-practices-in-api-design/ target=_blank>Best practices in API design</a><li><a href=https://blog.logrocket.com/current-state-rust-web-frameworks/ target=_blank>The current state of Rust web frameworks</a><li><a href=https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/ target=_blank>Rocket Guide</a><li><a href=https://actix.rs/docs/ target=_blank>Actix Documenation</a></ul><p>With these resources and a little bit of practice, you will be well on your way to writing your own API in Rust. Happy coding!</div><div class=column><img alt="Connecting the world" src=../10/connect-the-world.webp style=border:0;width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block></div></div><h2 id=introducing-lapce-a-new-editor-built-with-the-power-of-rust>Introducing Lapce: a new editor built with the power of Rust</h2><div class=row><div class=column><a href=https://lapce.dev/ target=_blank><img alt="Lapce editor" src=../10/Lapce-editor.webp style=border:0;width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block></a></div><div class=column>We are excited to highlight a new editor for programming in Rust: <a href=https://lapce.dev/ target=_blank>Lapce</a>. This graphical editor, is built in Rust and utilizes the power of Droid and OpenGL. <p>One of the things that sets Lapce apart is its clean and user-friendly interface. Additionally, it offers optional <a href=https://docs.lapce.dev/get-started/modal-editing target=_blank>modal-editing</a> with Vim-like modes, making it a great choice for those who prefer this type of editing.<p>Another feature we really liked is called <a href=https://docs.lapce.dev/features/code-lens target=_blank>Code Lens</a>, which allows for a more efficient way of folding code and getting a general overview of a file. Keep in mind that Lapce is currently still in its pre-alpha stage.<p>With ~23k Github stars and 129 contributors, Lapce is definitely worth checking, for a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_52ZUg-QmW0" target=_blank>youtube movie on Lapce</a> follow the link.<p>Other editors we have highlighted in previous newsletters are <a href=https://rust-trends.com/your-dev-environment-on-steroids/#helix target=_blank>Helix</a> (also written in Rust) and <a href=https://rust-trends.com/your-dev-environment-on-steroids/#vscode target=_blank>Visual Studio Code</a>.</div></div><h2 id=snippets>Snippets</h2><ul><li><a href=https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/01/26/Rust-1.67.0.html target=_blank>Rust 1.67.0 released</a>.

Supporting community events, such as Rust conferences and meetups, to foster collaboration and learning among Rust developers. Managing the trademark and branding of the Rust programming language to ensure consistency and protect against misuse. The Rust foundation also seeks to advance the state of the art in systems programming by supporting research and development in areas such as memory safety, performance, and language design. Overall, the goal of the Rust foundation is to ensure that the Rust programming language can continue to evolve and improve, while also providing a stable and sustainable platform for developers to build on. Moreover, <a href=https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/ target=_blank>the foundation gives out grants</a> to the public to fund initiatives related to Rust.<p>They recently released their <a href=https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-foundation-annual-report-2022/ target=_blank>annual report for 2022</a> that highlights the financials and important milestones.<hr><p>Enjoy your Sunday, and have a great week ahead.<p>Thanks for reading!<br> Bob Peters<p>Feel free to connect with me on <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/bjhpeters/ target=_blank>LinkedIn</a></section></article></main></div><div class=footer><br><hr><div style=font-size:x-large><a href=/signup/>Sign up for our Newsletter</a></div><br> © Copyright 2022-2025 Rust Trends.<br>All Rights Reserved | Powered by Rust and <a href=https://www.getzola.org/ target=_blank>Zola</a><br><br></div><script src="https://rust-trends.com/search.js?v=202509131212"></script>
