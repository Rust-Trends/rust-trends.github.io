The response was fantastic, and I've settled on a thrilling project to tackle — more on that in our next edition. But first, let’s talk about an intriguing discovery I made while gathering your suggestions: the <a href=https://probe.rs/ target=_blank>Probe-rs project</a>.<h3 id=introducing-probe-rs-a-rust-based-tool-for-embedded-development>Introducing Probe-rs: A Rust-Based Tool for Embedded Development</h3><p>In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, Rust is gaining momentum, and the embedded sector is no exception. Among the gems I discovered is Probe-rs, a powerful tool designed for embedded development, entirely written in Rust. This versatile toolkit serves as a debugger and a programmer, providing robust features for connecting with microcontrollers.<h3 id=what-makes-probe-rs-stand-out>What Makes Probe-rs Stand Out?</h3><p>Probe-rs isn’t just another tool; it exemplifies Rust’s capability to enhance system reliability and performance. It supports a range of hardware probes, including the innovative Rusty Probe, which is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. Additionally, it's compatible with established tools like the Segger JLink, offering flexibility for various development needs.<h3 id=the-rusty-probe-a-closer-look>The Rusty Probe: A Closer Look</h3><p>The <a href=https://shop.probe.rs/products/rusty-probe target=_blank>Rusty Probe</a> represents a significant advancement in the field, leveraging the safety and efficiency of Rust. Yes the firmware of this probe is also written in Rust. Therefore this hardware probe exemplifies how Rust can be utilized to create dependable and high-performing embedded tools that are both innovative and accessible. Note that all the hardware and firmware files of this probe are freely available.<h3 id=why-rust-and-probe-rs-are-game-changers-in-embedded-systems>Why Rust and Probe-rs Are Game Changers in Embedded Systems</h3><p>Using Rust for embedded systems offers numerous advantages, including enhanced safety, fewer bugs, and better control over low-level system details. Rust stands out as the first higher-level language that bridges the gap between various programming disciplines — from web development, desktop applications to systems programming — allowing a broader range of developers to enter the world of embedded systems. Probe-rs harnesses these strengths, providing developers with a powerful, reliable, and easy-to-use toolset that stands out in a crowded market.<h3 id=disclaimer-and-personal-note>Disclaimer and Personal Note</h3><p>I want to be transparent with you all — I recently purchased the Rusty Probe myself. They have a delivery time of 6 - weeks from now, so I haven't had the chance to test it out yet. I also want to clarify that I am not receiving any compensation for mentioning Probe-rs or the Rusty Probe. I'm just genuinely excited about the possibilities it offers and wanted to share this tool with you. I'll definitely keep you updated on my findings once I get my hands on it and start experimenting.<h2 id=snippets>Snippets</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ob8zkeq2s&ab_channel=JonGjengset" target=_blank>Decrusting the tokio crate with Jon Gjengset</a></p><li><p>Building a stock market engine in Rust <a href=https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/building-stock-market-engine-from-scratch-in-rust-i-9be7c110e137 target=_blank>part 1</a> and <a href=https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/building-stock-market-engine-from-scratch-in-rust-ii-0c7b5d8a60b6 target=_blank>part 2</a></p></ul><hr><p>We are thrilled to have you as part of our growing community of Rust enthusiasts!
