With this, you can install and update Rust conveniently from your command line.\nIf you do not want to install anything this might be something for you Rust Playground.\nWhat is the best way to learn Rust?\nRust is known for its great documentation. This is the official starting point to Learn Rust. For more resources look at our Newsletter Edition 26\nCan you learn Rust as your first programming language?\nYes, you can learn Rust as your first programming language, though it comes with both challenges and benefits.\nThe Reality: Rust has a reputation for being challenging, particularly due to concepts like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. Most experts suggest it's not the easiest first language. However, the landscape has improved significantly in recent years with better documentation and learning resources.\nWhy It Can Work:\n\nStrong Community Support: The Rust community is incredibly welcoming with active forums, Discord servers, and mentorship opportunities\nExcellent Documentation: The Rust Book is comprehensive and beginner-friendly\nModern Language Design: You'll learn good programming practices from the start without picking up bad habits\nGrowing Demand: Rust developers are highly sought after, with a 68.75% increase in commercial Rust usage between 2021-2024\n\nLearning Path for Beginners:\n\nStart with The Rust Book\nPractice with Rustlings exercises\nJoin the /r/learnrust subreddit and Rust Community Discord\nBuild projects on CodeCrafters for hands-on learning (referral link - but I wouldn't recommend it if it weren't genuinely excellent)\n\nBottom Line: While challenging, many beginners successfully learn Rust as their first language in 2024. Companies report typical onboarding time of 3-6 months for new Rust developers.

Whether you are looking to learn more about the language, stay up-to-date with the latest developments, or just get some inspiration for your next project, we’ve got you covered. So please grab a cup of coffee and join us as we explore the world of Rust!\nIn today’s email:\n\nAlgorithms written in Rust\nWill this be your next Operating System in Rust?\nNetworking with Rust crates\n\nAlgorithms written in Rust\n\nAlgorithms are a crucial part of computer science, and they play a vital role in many areas of software development. From sorting data to searching for information, algorithms help us solve problems and perform tasks efficiently.\nIf you are a Rust programmer looking to learn more about algorithms, a great resource to check out is this website. The website is accompanied by this repository that showcases the collection of algorithms written in Rust.\nThe “TheAlgorithms/Rust” repository contains a wide range of algorithms, including those for sorting, searching, and ciphers. It also includes implementations of various data structures, such as lists, trees, and graphs. The repository is maintained by contributors who are committed to keeping it up-to-date and relevant for Rust programmers.\nIf you are interested in learning more about algorithms and how they can be implemented in Rust, be sure to check it out. The nice thing about the website is that it uses the online playground platform, so you do not need to have Rust installed to try it out.\nWill this be your next Operating System in Rust?\nRust is a language that is gaining popularity in Operating System (OS) development and the Raspberry Pi is a low-cost and powerful platform that can be used to learn and experiment with building an OS.\nThere are several tutorials and resources available for learning how to develop an OS in Rust on the Raspberry Pi, including creating a custom kernel, developing drivers, and creating a minimal operating system. There are also projects like TockOS, which uses Rust to create a secure and efficient embedded operating system.\nThe Rust programming language provides a powerful and safe alternative for building an OS on the Raspberry Pi. The growing community and resources available make it an attractive choice for those interested in this field.\nNetworking with Rust crates\nRust is a system programming language, that provides a safe and efficient way to build networked systems. One of the key features of Rust for network programming is its low-level control over memory, which allows for building high-performance and efficient networked systems. Additionally, Rust provides built-in support for low-level network programming, such as socket programming, which enables developers to handle network protocols such as TCP, UDP, and other transport protocols.\nTo get started with network programming in Rust, you can use the standard library‘s support for low-level network programming, such as the std::net module, or use specialized libraries such as mio and tokio which provide more high-level abstractions and are built on top of the standard library.\nHere are a few resources that you may find helpful when getting started with network programming in Rust:\nThe Rust documentation on Network Programming\nThe Tokio project and the starter tutorial\nMio: minimalistic, efficient async I/O library for Rust.\n\nEnjoy your Sunday, and have a great week ahead.\nThanks for reading!\nBob Peters\nFeel free to connect with me on LinkedIn\n","id":"https://rust-trends.com/newsletter/algorithms-networking-and-operating-systems/","title":"9 - Algorithms, Networking and Operating Systems"},"https://rust-trends.com/newsletter/are-we-embedded-yet/":{"body":"\nThis edition is to check in on the state of Rust for Embedded Systems\nHello, Rustaceans!\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Rust Trends newsletter. We have an exciting lineup of articles prepared for you, packed with valuable insights and updates from the world of Rust programming.\nIn this edition, we focus on embedded systems and the roadblocks that stand in the way of Rust adoption. We will also introduce you to a hex viewer written in Rust, for your binary data analysis needs.\nSo grab your favorite beverage, sit back, and let's dive right in!\nEmbedded Systems and the 5 Roadblocks to Rust Adoption\n\nRust has been making progress as a language for adoption in the embedded systems world. However, several significant roadblocks hinder its widespread acceptance. This article on Embedded.com highlights 5 roadblocks to Rust adoption in embedded systems. These are the takeaways:\n\nRust faces roadblocks in embedded systems adoption due to limited commercial support from microcontroller vendors, leaving developers to figure things out on their own.\nThe learning curve for Rust is steeper than other languages, leading to higher training costs and longer development times for teams interested in using it for embedded systems.\nConservative adoption of technologies in the embedded industry, coupled with the investment in existing workflows and talent, makes switching to Rust less appealing for many companies.\nRust's integration with existing toolchains and development processes in embedded systems may require significant rework, potentially leading to lost insights and additional development time.\nThe lack of a formal specification and standardization in Rust poses challenges for commercial support and consistency, particularly in safety-critical applications with long product lifetimes.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions, \"I hate to say it, but an experienced professional can do the same things in C or C++ that a Rust programmer can do just as safely.\" I strongly disagree with this statement. The reason why embedded firmware has so many vulnerabilities is that languages like C and C++ do not provide inherent protection against making mistakes in the first place. As humans, we are prone to errors, and in my opinion, enforcing programming practices that ensure the correct approach is the only truly safe way forward.\nThe key food for thought is: How can the industry strike a balance between risk aversion and embracing new technologies to drive progress?\nEmbedded Rust: the lay of the land\n\nFor starters a nice overview for Embedded Rust is the repository Awesome Embedded Rust. The official Embedded Rust Book and a great blogpost by the Mbedded Ninja.\nMoreover several microcontroller vendors have started providing support (un) officially for the Rust programming language. Here are a few notable ones:\n\n\nNordic Semiconductor support for Rust for their nrf52,  and nrf53 series of microcontrollers. They provide a Rust-enabled software hardware abstraction layer called nrf-hal, which allows developers to write firmware using Rust for their microcontrollers.\n\n\nSTMicroelectronics Rust support for their STM32 microcontroller family. They offer a Rust-specific hardware abstraction layer (HAL) called stm32-rs, enabling developers to write embedded software in Rust for STM32 microcontrollers.\n\n\nNXP Semiconductors Rust support for their i.MX RT series of microcontrollers. They offer the imxrt-rs crate, which is a Rust API for programming i.MX RT microcontrollers, allowing developers to leverage the Rust language for embedded development.\n\n\nEspressif official support for the popular ESP32 controllers. They offer esp-rs crate and the ESP32 book.\n\n\nInfineon official support for Rust for their (Automotive) Microcontrollers.\n\n\nIt's important to note that the availability and extent of Rust support may vary among different microcontroller vendors and their specific microcontroller families. It's always recommended to consult the official documentation and resources provided by the respective vendors for the most up-to-date information on Rust support.\nHex Viewer: Empowering Binary Data Analysis with Rust\n\nHex editors play a crucial role in low-level data analysis and manipulation. Every embedded system developer should have one in their toolkit.\nHexyl, a powerful hex viewer for the terminal, is written entirely in Rust. It utilizes colored output to differentiate various categories of bytes, offering an efficient and intuitive approach to working with binary data.\nAn example of a well-known hack that involved the use of a hex editor:\nIs the case of the \"Pac-Man Kill Screen\" in the classic arcade game Pac-Man. In the original Pac-Man arcade machine, a bug caused the game to reach an unplayable level 256, known as the \"kill screen.\" This bug occurred due to an integer overflow issue, where the game's code was unable to handle a higher level number.\nIn order to bypass this issue and reach the kill screen intentionally, some skilled players and hackers used a hex editor to modify the game's code. By locating the specific section of code responsible for the level counter and adjusting it, they were able to bypass the limitations and continue playing beyond level 256.

The Rust community is thriving and has an abundance of informative articles, tutorials, applications, and repositories. However, with so much to choose from, it can be overwhelming. We have handpicked the best of the best for you, so let’s dive in!\nIn today’s email:\n\nConnecting the world with Rust\nIntroducing Lapce: a new editor built with the power of Rust\nThe Rust Foundation\n\nConnecting the world with Rust\nWriting your own API (Application Programming Interface) can be a rewarding and challenging task. An API allows you to expose specific functionality of your software to other developers, enabling them to interact with your application in a predictable and standardized way. In this article, we will take a look at what it takes to write your own API in Rust.\nBefore you start writing your API, it is important to think about what you want to achieve with it. Do you want to expose specific functionality of your application to other developers? Do you want to allow other applications to access data stored in your application? Answering these questions will help you determine the scope and functionality of your API.\nOnce you have a clear idea of what you want your API to do, the next step is to choose a framework for building it. There are several popular options for building APIs in Rust, the most popular ones are Rocket and Actix. Each of these frameworks has its own set of features and benefits, so it is worth doing some research to determine which one is the best fit for your needs.\nOnce you have chosen a framework, you can start designing the structure and functionality of your API. This will involve creating endpoints, which are specific points of access for interacting with your API, and defining the input and output of each endpoint. You will also need to consider how you want to handle authentication, error handling, and other important aspects of API development. To learn more see some links below:\n\nBest practices in API design\nThe current state of Rust web frameworks\nRocket Guide\nActix Documenation\n\nWith these resources and a little bit of practice, you will be well on your way to writing your own API in Rust.

In this edition, we will bring back the good old times with retro gaming in Rust! Moreover, this newsletter showcases a visualization tool for a better understanding of Rust programs in terms of borrowing, heap, and stack. Grab some coffee and let’s dive in…\nNintendo Emulator in Rust\nAn emulator is a software program that is designed to emulate the behavior of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), a popular video game console that was first released in the mid-1980s. The purpose of an emulator is to allow you to play Nintendo games on your computer or e.g. your Raspberry Pico without the need for the original console.\nWhen you run an NES emulator, written in Rust, on your computer or other devices, it creates a virtual environment that mimics the hardware of the original NES console. The emulator includes software that emulates the various components of the console, such as the CPU, and the graphics processing unit. The emulator also includes software that can read and interpret the code of NES game cartridges, which you can download here and play in the NES wasm emulator in your browser.\nOnce the emulator is up and running, you can load the virtual game cartridges into the emulator, and it will execute the code of the game as if it were being played on the original console. The emulator will output the video that the game would generate on the original hardware, allowing you to play the game on your computer.\nOverall, an NES emulator is a powerful tool that allows users to enjoy classic NES games on modern hardware, preserving the experience of playing these games for future generations.\nMemory management: what the hack is a Stack and Heap?\n\nThe stack and the heap are two areas of memory that a program can use to store data.\nThe stack is a memory region that is used to keep track of function calls and local variables. It works like a stack of plates: you add a new plate (or item) to the top of the stack, and when you are done with it, you remove it from the top. This order is called Last In First Out (LIFO). The simplicity makes it fast because it can be managed easily and either lives in RAM (fast) or cache (faster) of your CPU. Moreover, the stack is limited in size\nThe heap, on the other hand, is a larger and more flexible area of memory that can be used to store data that is too large to fit on the stack or needs to be dynamically allocated during the program’s execution (e.g. mutable vectors or Boxed variables).\nOverall, the stack is faster and more efficient, but it has less memory available and is less flexible. The heap is slower and more complex, but it can be used to store larger amounts of data and is more flexible. Knowing when to use each of these memory regions is an important part of writing efficient and effective computer programs. To understand the choices that are made on memory management in Rust (e.g. ownership), knowing what a Stack and Heap are is a must.\nSome nice reading material:\n\nA stack and heap discussion on StackOverflow\nThe Stack and the Heap in Rust\nStack based memory allocation on Wikipedia\nHeap based memory allocation on Wikipedia\n\n\nUnderstanding code with help of a visualization tool\nThe Rust borrow checker is a key component of the Rust programming language that enforces ownership and borrowing rules at compile-time, ensuring that programs are free from certain kinds of memory errors such as data races and null pointer dereferences. The borrow checker analyzes a Rust program’s use of mutable and immutable references to ensure that they are used correctly and that the lifetime of the references is valid throughout the program’s execution. By enforcing these rules, the borrow checker helps Rust programs achieve memory safety and prevents common programming errors that can lead to crashes or security vulnerabilities.\nTo get a better understanding of this topic Aquascope can be a very useful tool.\n“Aquascope is a tool that generates interactive visualizations of Rust programs. These visualizations show how Rust’s borrow checker “thinks” about a program, and how a Rust program actually executes.”\nGo ahead and give it a try!\n\nEnjoy your Sunday, and have a great week ahead.\nThanks for reading!\nBob Peters\nFeel free to connect with me on LinkedIn\n","id":"https://rust-trends.com/newsletter/emulators-and-memory-management-visualization/","title":"12 - Emulators and memory management visualization"},"https://rust-trends.com/newsletter/energy-efficiency-combined-with-style/":{"body":"\n\nRunning Rust on AWS Lambda, improve your coding style and a blazing fast CLI search tool written in Rust\n\nThe third newsletter with your dose of Rust Trends.

Last but not least some tips and tricks on how to improve build times.\nThank you for being part of our growing community. Enjoy and Happy coding!\nUnderstanding Miri: A Crucial Tool for Rust Developers\n\nRust is celebrated for its memory safety guarantees, and one of the key tools that help enforce these guarantees is Miri. In this article, we’ll dive into what Miri is, why it’s an essential tool for Rust developers, and when you should consider using it.\nWhat is Miri?\nMiri is an interpreter for Rust’s Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR). MIR is a simplified version of Rust code that the compiler uses for various analyses and optimizations before generating machine code. Miri interprets MIR, allowing it to execute Rust code and check for undefined behavior at runtime. This makes it an invaluable tool for debugging and ensuring code correctness.\nWhy Use Miri?\nDetecting Undefined Behavior: Miri can detect many forms of undefined behavior, such as:\n\nUse of uninitialized memory.\nOut-of-bounds array access.\nViolations of pointer aliasing rules.\nMisuse of unsafe code blocks.\n\nUndefined behavior can lead to unpredictable and often dangerous consequences in software, including security vulnerabilities and crashes. Miri’s ability to catch these issues early can save countless hours of debugging and increase the reliability of your code.\nDebugging Unsafe Code: Unsafe code in Rust allows developers to perform operations that are not checked by the compiler for safety. While this can be necessary for performance or interfacing with hardware, it also introduces risks. Miri provides a way to execute and test unsafe code paths with additional checks, making it easier to ensure they do not introduce undefined behavior.\nTeaching and Learning: Miri is an excellent educational tool. For those learning Rust, understanding how and why certain operations can lead to undefined behavior helps deepen their comprehension of Rust’s safety guarantees and the importance of following best practices.\nWhen to Use Miri?\nDuring Development: Integrate Miri into your development workflow to catch undefined behavior as early as possible. This is particularly useful when working with complex algorithms or unsafe code blocks. Running Miri on your tests can help identify subtle bugs that might not be caught by regular testing.\nCode Reviews and Audits: When reviewing code, especially those containing unsafe blocks or interfacing with low-level system components, using Miri can provide an additional layer of assurance. It helps reviewers identify potential issues that might not be obvious from code inspection alone.\n**Educational Settings: **For educators and students, using Miri to explore how Rust enforces memory safety and handles low-level operations can provide valuable insights. It’s a practical tool for demonstrating the consequences of undefined behavior and the importance of safe coding practices.\nConclusion\nMiri is a powerful tool for Rust developers, providing an extra layer of safety and debugging capabilities. By integrating Miri into your workflow, you can catch undefined behavior early, ensure the safety of your unsafe code, and deepen your understanding of Rust’s safety guarantees. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting with Rust, Miri is an essential tool that can help you write safer, more reliable code.\nFor more information and detailed documentation, visit the official Miri repository\nReferences:\n\nMiri GitHub Repository\nLearning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists: Miri\nRalf Jung’s Blog on Miri\nRust's playground also supports Miri (see tools menu)\n\nSpeeding Up Rust Compile Times&gt;\n\nCompiling Rust code can sometimes feel slow, but there are numerous strategies to optimize it.

But how to handle them?\nI am excited to bring you a new edition of our newsletter, focused on a topic that is crucial to every programmer: error handling in Rust. No matter how experienced or talented you are, errors are an inevitable part of the programming process. But do not worry, Rust provides a robust and efficient way to handle them.\nIn this edition, we will dive into the world of error handling in Rust and explore how you can handle errors in your programs with ease. From the Result type and the ? operator, to the match operator and beyond, we will cover all the essential elements of error handling in Rust. So, without further ado, let’s dive in!\nIntroduction to Error Handling\nThe idea behind error handling in Rust is to make it explicit and unavoidable for the programmer to deal with errors. If you look at other programming languages handling errors is optional. E.g. if you do not use a Try and Except in Python you can still run your script. This can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to debug and fix.\nRust achieves strict handling of errors by using its type system to force it at compile time. In other words, the code will not compile and therefore not run. Which makes writing incorrect code harder from the start.\nErrors in Rust can be classified into two categories:\n\nRecoverable errors\nUnrecoverable errors\n\nRecoverable errors are errors that can be handled and recovered from within the program. These errors are usually indicated by the Result type, which represents the result of an operation that might fail.\nUnrecoverable errors, on the other hand, are errors that cannot be handled within the program and cause the program to terminate immediately. These errors are usually indicated by using the panic! macro or assert macro that calls panic!, which stops the program and displays an error message. Unrecoverable errors are typically used for cases where something unexpected has occurred, such as an assertion failure or a bug in the code.\nIn my opinion, there is no justification for intentionally causing a panic. This is because panics can always be replaced with recoverable errors, which provide a more flexible and controlled method of handling errors. So we will focus on the recoverable errors.\nRecoverable errors\nIn Rust, errors are represented as values of the `Result` type, which is an enumeration with two variants: Ok and Err.\nWhen an operation returns Ok(T), it means that the operation was successful and the value of type T is returned.\nWhen an operation returns Err(E), it means that the operation failed and an error of type E is returned.\nThe programmer can then handle the error by using techniques such as pattern matching, propagating the error up the call stack with the ? operator, or by using error-handling functions such as unwrap() or expect().\nBesides the Result type there is another important type called Option. In Rust, the Option type is a way to represent the presence or absence of a value. It is a generic enum with two variants: Some(T) and None. Some(T) holds a value of type T, while None represents the absence of a value.\nFor example, you can use an Option value to represent the result of a function that may or may not find a value, like searching a vector for an item. Instead of returning an error code or throwing an exception, the function would return Some(T) if a value was found and None otherwise.\nIn this way, the Option type can be seen as part of error handling because it provides a way to handle the absence of a value in a type-safe and explicit way, without relying on error codes or exceptions.\nThe following links might be useful to you to dive deeper into the discussed topics:\n\nThe Rust Book: Recoverable Errors\nError struct in the standard library\nThe Result type in the standard library\nGreat blog post by Burntsushi (Andrew Gallant)\nAnother blog post on unwrap by Burntsushi\n\n\nSnippets\n\nRust as a programming language for automotive software?\nDid you know there is also a Rust Trends LinkedIn Page?\nRust 1.67.1, February the 9th.

With Ferrocene, the future of safe coding in critical applications looks promising.\nJoin Ferrous Systems announcement party on October 4th, 2023, online.\nFearless concurrency with Rayon\n\nRayon is a powerful data-parallelism library for Rust that allows developers to easily convert sequential computations into parallel ones. It's incredibly lightweight and ensures data-race freedom, providing a safe environment for parallel execution.\nThe beauty of Rayon lies in its simplicity. To convert a sequential iterator into a parallel one, you typically just replace your iter() call with par_iter(), and Rayon handles the rest. This makes it straightforward to leverage the power of parallel computing in your Rust applications.\nRayon also offers the join and scope functions for creating parallel tasks manually, providing more flexibility when needed. Moreover, it supports custom thread pools, giving you even more control over your parallel computations.\nOne of the key features of Rayon is its guarantee of data-race freedom. This means that if your code compiles, it will typically behave the same way it did before, but faster. Parallel iterators, in particular, are guaranteed to produce the same results as their sequential counterparts.\nTo use Rayon, you simply add it as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file and bring the necessary traits into scope using the Rayon prelude. Rayon currently requires Rustc 1.59.0 or greater.\nRayon also supports WebAssembly through an adapter and some project configuration. This allows you to bring the power of Rayon to web applications.\nKey Takeaways:\n\nRayon allows easy conversion of sequential computations into parallel ones in Rust.\nIt guarantees data-race freedom, ensuring safe parallel execution.\nRayon supports custom thread pools and manual task creation for greater flexibility.\nIt's compatible with WebAssembly, extending its use to web applications.\n\nThought-Provoking Questions:\n\nHow can the simplicity of converting sequential iterators to parallel ones with Rayon change the way we approach programming in Rust?\nWhat impact does the guarantee of data-race freedom have on the reliability of parallel computing in Rust?\nHow can the WebAssembly support in Rayon broaden its application in web development?\n\nFor more information, check out the Rayon GitHub page.

Firstly, idiomatic Rust code tends to be easier to read and maintain, both for yourself and for others who may work with your code in the future. It can also be more efficient, as Rust’s unique features like zero-cost abstractions and memory safety can be utilized to write high-performance code.\nIn addition, following Rust’s conventions and best practices can help you avoid common pitfalls and mistakes that can lead to bugs and security vulnerabilities. By utilizing Rust’s ownership and borrowing system, for example, you can avoid issues like null pointer dereferencing and memory leaks.\nFurthermore, writing idiomatic Rust code can help you become a better Rust programmer. By understanding Rust’s unique features and conventions, you can become more proficient in the language and better equipped to write high-quality, efficient code.\nIf you are interested in learning more about idiomatic Rust, the Rust programming language website provides extensive documentation on Rust’s design philosophy and best practices, as well as tutorials on e.g. traits, cheatsheets, and examples of idiomatic Rust code. There are also many online communities and forums dedicated to Rust programming, where you can ask questions and share knowledge with other Rust programmers.\nIn conclusion, writing idiomatic Rust code can help you write more maintainable, efficient, and secure programs, and become a better Rust programmer overall.\n\nFunctional programming in Rust\n  In Rust functional programming is not a strict requirement, but often used in conjunction with idiomatic Rust to achieve more concise, expressive, and safe code.\nFunctional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions to perform computations. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. Functional programming also emphasizes immutability, meaning that data structures and variables should not be changed once they are created. Instead, new data structures and variables are created based on existing ones.\nRust provides a number of features that make functional programming easier, such as closures, iterators, and pattern matching. These features allow Rust programmers to write code that is both idiomatic and functional, using functions as building blocks to express complex behavior in a clear and efficient way.\nFor those interested in functional programming in Rust, there are several resources available as well. The Rust Programming Language book includes a chapter on functional programming, which provides an introduction to functional programming concepts and how they can be applied in Rust. Moreover, there are blog posts, like this and this.\n\nCargo Fix\nCargo’s cargo fix subcommand has been a useful tool for Rust programmers to automatically fix some simple compiler warnings, such as unused imports or variables, since its introduction. Over time, the number of warnings that can be fixed automatically has steadily increased, making it even more valuable to developers.\nIn addition to its existing capabilities, the cargo fix subcommand now also supports automatically fixing some simple Clippy warnings. This means that developers can now rely on Cargo to handle even more of their code maintenance tasks, freeing up time for more important work.\nTo draw more attention to these increased capabilities, Cargo will now suggest running cargo fix or cargo clippy –fix when it detects warnings that are automatically fixable. For example, when a warning is issued for an unused import Cargo will suggest running cargo fix to fix the issue.\nOverall, these updates to Cargo’s cargo fix subcommand are a welcome addition to the Rust ecosystem, making it even easier for developers to write clean and efficient Rust code. To use these great features make sure to upgrade to the latest version of Rust 1.69.0   \n\nDo not be afraid to try new things in Rust.

The team emphasizes the importance of regular testing against the latest dependencies, regardless of whether the Cargo.lock file is committed.\nThe update addresses several issues:\n\nBackground: The old guidelines helped maintain high quality in Rust's package ecosystem but also had downsides like making it harder to bisect code history.\nWhy the Change: Rust's growing mainstream adoption and the need for a better onboarding experience for new developers have necessitated this change.\nWider Ecosystem: Advances in CI and tools like Dependabot have provided alternative ways to manage dependencies, making the old guidance less relevant.\n\nFor more details and to provide feedback, you can read the full blog post on the Rust Blog and the updated Cargo Book\nSpeeding Up Rust Compile Times: Insights from August 2023\n\nThe Rust programming language is known for its focus on safety and performance, but compile times can sometimes be a bottleneck for developers. Nicholas Nethercote, a contributor to the Rust compiler, recently published an article detailing various improvements made to speed up the Rust compiler as of August 2023. Here's a summary of key takeaways to help you speed up your\nRust compile times.\nHash Algorithm Update for Incremental Compilation\nIn the realm of incremental compilation, a notable enhancement was introduced through pull request #107925. This update modified the hashing algorithm responsible for detecting changes in code fragments. Specifically, the algorithm was transitioned from SipHash-2-4 to SipHash-1-3. As a result, the average wall-time for compilation was reduced by 1.63%. This optimization is particularly beneficial for incremental builds, where the hash function plays a crucial role in identifying code changes that require recompilation.\nLLVM Version Upgrades Boost Rust Compiler Efficiency\nThe Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) plays a pivotal role in the Rust compiler's back-end, handling tasks like code optimization and generation. Two separate pull requests (#109474 and an update to LLVM 17) were responsible for upgrading the LLVM version used by the Rust compiler. These upgrades led to a reduction in average wall-time by 1.19% and 1.91%, respectively. The enhancements are attributed to both the increased efficiency of LLVM itself and the superior quality of the code it produces.\nStreamlining Code Checks for Faster Compilation\nLints in Rust are essentially code checks that help identify issues like syntax errors or potential bugs. A specific update, made through pull request #113734, optimized the way these code checks (lints) are executed. This led to a 1.05% reduction in the average time it takes to compile a project. Just like some of the other updates, this one also particularly benefits incremental builds, where only parts of the code that have changed are recompiled.\nEnhancements in Codegen Units and Parallelization\nThe Rust compiler has been fine-tuned to better utilize parallelization, particularly in its back-end operations. A minimum size for Codegen Units (CGUs) has been introduced in non-incremental builds. This change helps in reducing both peak memory (up to 19%) usage and the size of the compiled binary. However, the author points out that perfecting this aspect is challenging, given the multiple metrics that sometimes conflict with each other.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile the improvements may seem incremental, they add up over time and contribute to a more efficient compilation process. The article also touches on other areas like runtime benchmarking and future improvements, making it a comprehensive read for anyone interested in Rust compiler performance.\nNavigating the Serde Controversy: A Lesson in Community Trust and Security for Rust Developers\n\nWhat Happened:\nThe Serde project, a popular serialization library in Rust, faced backlash from the community for shipping precompiled binaries. The issue arose when the project's maintainers decided to include precompiled binaries in the package, which is against the norms of the Rust ecosystem. The binaries were intended to speed up the build process, but they raised concerns about security and trust within the community. The situation led to a heated debate, with some developers even considering forking the project (source: BleepingComputer).\nHow It Was Recovered:\nThe Serde project took immediate action to address the concerns raised by the community. An issue was opened on GitHub to discuss the matter transparently. They acknowledged the community's concerns and decided to revert the changes that included precompiled binaries. The issue was marked as resolved, and the project moved forward with its regular development cycle, ensuring to maintain the trust and security standards expected in the Rust ecosystem (GitHub Issue #2538)\nThe proposed forking by some community members would have been a poor outcome, leading to fragmentation and potential confusion. Personally, I am very pleased with how the situation was handled and resolved, reinforcing the importance of community trust and collaboration.\nThis incident serves as a lesson for the Rust community about the importance of maintaining trust and security while making changes that could potentially affect many projects.\nRelease Note:\nSerde release v1.0.184: Restore from-source serde_derive build on all platforms - eventually we'd like to use a first-class precompiled macro if such a thing becomes supported by cargo / crates.io\nSnippets\n\nRust 1.72.0 stable is out\nBest Rust Web Frameworks to Use in 2023\nRust Malware Staged on Crates.io\n\n\nWe are thrilled to have you as part of our growing community of Rust enthusiasts!

Let's code!\nRust vs Go: A Comparison of Two Popular Programming Languages\n\nRust and Go are two of the most popular programming languages in 2023, both with a strong focus on performance, concurrency, and reliability. However, they also have different design goals, features, and use cases, making them suitable for different kinds of projects. In this article, we will compare Rust and Go in terms of syntax, speed, safety, and ecosystem, and see which language is better for your needs.\nSyntax\nRust and Go have very different syntaxes, reflecting their different philosophies and trade-offs. Rust has a complex and expressive syntax, with many keywords, symbols, and concepts to learn. Rust's syntax is designed to enforce memory safety and prevent common errors at compile time, but it also comes with a steep learning curve and a longer development time if you do not include the debugging time. Go, on the other hand, has a simple and minimalist syntax, with few keywords, symbols, and concepts to learn. Go's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. Go also has a fast compilation time and a built-in code formatter, similar to Rust's rustfmt, making it easier to develop and maintain code.\nSpeed\nBoth Rust and Go are fast languages, with a compiled and statically typed nature. However, Rust has an edge over Go in terms of speed and efficiency, thanks to its zero-cost abstractions and low-level control. Rust allows you to write high-level code without sacrificing performance, as it optimizes away any unnecessary overhead at compile time. Rust also gives you direct access to the hardware and memory management, allowing you to fine-tune your code for optimal performance. Go, on the other hand, has some limitations in terms of speed and efficiency, due to its garbage collector. Go's garbage collector frees up memory automatically, but it also introduces some runtime overhead and latency. Go only recently added generics since 1.18, which were already longer available in Rust.\nSafety\nBoth Rust and Go are safe languages, with a strong emphasis on reliability and correctness. However, they achieve safety in different ways. Rust guarantees memory safety through its ownership system and borrow checker, which ensure that there are no dangling pointers, data races, or memory leaks in your code. Rust also supports other safety features, such as algebraic data types (enums), pattern matching (match), error handling (Result), and testing (#[test]). Go ensures safety through its garbage collector, which manages memory automatically and prevents memory leaks. Go also supports other safety features, such as interfaces (interface{}), defer statements (defer), error handling (error), and testing (testing).\nEcosystem\nBoth Rust and Go have a rich and growing ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, tools, and communities. However, they also have different strengths and weaknesses in their ecosystems. Rust has a more diverse and innovative ecosystem, with many cutting-edge projects in various domains such as web development (Actix, Rocket), game development (Amethyst, Bevy), machine learning (Linfa, Smartcore), blockchain (Substrate), embedded systems (Are we Embedded yet? ), etc. Rust also has a strong community of developers who are passionate about the language and its vision. However, Rust also has a more fragmented and unstable ecosystem, with many libraries still in early stages of development or undergoing frequent changes. Go has a more mature and stable ecosystem, with many well-established projects in various domains such as web development (Gin), microservices (Go-kit), cloud computing (Kubernetes), distributed systems (etcd), etc. Go also has a large community of developers who are pragmatic about the language and its trade-offs. However, Go also has a more conservative and homogeneous ecosystem, with fewer innovations or experiments in the language or its libraries.\nConclusion\nRust and Go are both excellent programming languages that offer high performance, concurrency, and reliability. However, they also have different trade-offs that make them suitable for different kinds of projects. Rust is more suitable for low-latency and high-speed applications that require fine-grained control over the hardware and memory management. Rust is also more suitable for complex applications that benefit from expressive syntax and zero-cost abstractions. Go is more suitable for backend applications and web systems that require fast development time and easy scalability. Go is also more suitable for simple applications that benefit from minimalist syntax and garbage collection.\nTo read more about Rust vs Go check the links below:\n\nRust Vs.

It provides more compact and faster implementations of locks, which often result in better performance for applications.\nOne of the main reasons to consider using parking_lot is its efficient handling of thread locking and unlocking, which can lead to reduced contention and overhead in multithreaded scenarios. Unlike the standard Rust mutexes that rely on OS primitives, parking_lot mutexes are based on a spinning model followed by an OS-assisted sleep model when contention is detected. This approach typically uses less memory and offers faster lock acquisition and release in both contested and uncontested scenarios.\nIntegration can be as simple as find and replace in your code, because in most cases parking_lot uses the same interfaces as the standard library's synchronization primitives.\nIn summary, if your Rust application requires efficient concurrency management and you encounter limitations with the standard library's primitives, parking_lot might offer the performance improvements and additional features you need.\nSnippets\n\n$1M Microsoft Donation to Fund Rust Foundation\nHow to rewrite a C++ codebase successfully\nRust 1.78 Release\n\n\nWe are thrilled to have you as part of our growing community of Rust enthusiasts!

We're witnessing an adoption surge that only comes once in a programming language's lifetime, 68.75% enterprise growth, faster compile times, and Fortune 500 companies betting their infrastructure on memory safety.\nThis isn't just another year for Rust. This is the year.\nThe Enterprise Surge: 68.75% Growth Can't Be Ignored\nLet's be honest, when AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all doubled down on Rust, we knew something significant was happening. The numbers don't lie: commercial Rust usage exploded by 68.75% between 2021-2024, and throughout 2025 we've seen that trend accelerate. (Official 2024 State of Rust Survey Results)\nShopify's Big Move: Back in 2022, Shopify became the Rust Foundation's inaugural Gold member, and their commitment continues to grow. Their YJIT Ruby compiler implementation using Rust has been a game-changer for Ruby performance. This isn't just about supporting open source; it's about betting their infrastructure on Rust's future.\nThe AWS Effect: Amazon's Firecracker microVMs written in Rust continue to prove Rust's enterprise readiness. When you're managing millions of serverless functions, memory safety isn't just nice to have, it's mission-critical.\nRust at Microsoft – Security-Driven Push (May 2025) At Rust Nation UK, Microsoft, Azure CTO Mark Russinovich detailed why Microsoft is scaling Rust adoption. A decade of data showed that 70 percent of security vulnerabilities originated from unsafe memory usage in C/C++ code. Rust’s ownership model and memory safety directly address this risk. Microsoft is accelerating its migration from vulnerable C/C++ to safer Rust, especially for security-critical infrastructure.\nCloudflare Builds High-Performance AI Inference Engine in Rust (August 2025)\nCloudflare developed Infire, a custom LLM inference engine written in Rust. Infire delivers faster inference (up to 7% faster than vLLM) with lower CPU overhead and more efficient GPU utilization. It now powers Llama 3.1 8B on Cloudflare’s edge network. \nWhy Now?: The primary enterprise use cases tell the story: cloud infrastructure, high-frequency trading, blockchain, and IoT networks. These aren't experiments anymore; they're production workloads handling billions of requests.\nThe Compilation Revolution: 30% Faster Builds\nRemember when Rust compile times were the running joke in our community? Those days are fading. The performance improvements this year have been substantial:\n\n30%+ wall-time reduction through the new rust-lld linker as default on Linux, with some benchmarks showing even larger gains.\nAutomatic cache cleanup in Cargo, so no more manual disk cleanup.\n\nWhat Changed? Recent Rust releases delivered major compiler optimizations, better dependency resolution, and defaulting to faster linkers. The sustained focus on compiler performance is transforming the development experience, making Rust not just safer than C++, but faster to iterate with.\nDeveloper Experience: Faster compilation means tighter feedback loops, more experimentation, and ultimately, a smoother workflow.\nAI &amp; Rust: The Unlikely Power Couple\nPython still rules machine learning research, but in 2025 Rust has carved out a clear role in production. AI workloads demand predictable performance, tight memory control, and reliability at scale, areas where Rust excels. The result: teams prototype in Python, then deploy with Rust.\n\nCandle by Hugging Face is a Rust-native ML framework built for inference, not training. It’s designed for serverless and edge environments where low latency and small binaries matter.\nBurn is another Rust-based deep learning framework. It focuses on modular design and flexible backends, and is gaining attention for research and experimentation in Rust’s ecosystem.\nRust–Python integration is rising fast. Usage of Rust for Python extensions grew 22% year-over-year, showing how teams combine Python’s ergonomics with Rust’s performance in production.\nWebAssembly synergy is giving edge AI new life. Candle already runs models directly in browsers via WASM, delivering near-native performance without a heavyweight runtime.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Rust is not replacing Python in AI, but it’s becoming the language of choice for turning research prototypes into production-grade, efficient inference systems.\nTooling Spotlight: Zed Editor\nSpeaking of developer experience, Zed code editor has been making waves this year. This Rust-written editor has been challenging VS Code's dominance, and the performance difference is noticeable. The collaborative features have proven innovative.\nWhy It Matters: When developers increasingly choose tools written in Rust for their daily workflow, it reflects the language's maturity and ecosystem health.\nLooking Ahead: The Rust Vision Doc\nThe Rust team has been developing a high-level roadmap for the next few years. With the language's 10-year anniversary having passed this May (May 15, 2025), this year has been perfect for reflecting on how far we've come and where we're heading.\n2025 Focus: Rust’s H1 2025 efforts prioritized stabilizing compiler flags and tooling rather than launching new language features—a maturity-oriented shift that enterprises wanted to see. The language’s broader adoption in sectors like cloud, AI, and embedded systems suggests Rust’s role is expanding beyond traditional systems programming and more becoming a foundational language for enterprise infrastructure.\nSnippets\n\nRust programming language hits #13 on TIOBE Index (February 2025 peak) and currently at #18\nCrates.io Trusted Publishing with OpenID Connect for secure CI/CD pipelines\n\nThe Inflection Point\nLooking at the data from 2024/2025, one thing becomes crystal clear: we're witnessing Rust's transition from \"promising systems language\" to \"essential enterprise technology.\" The 68.75% adoption surge isn't just growth it's validation of a fundamental shift in how we think about systems programming.\nThe Perfect Storm: Three factors converged this year to create Rust's breakthrough moment:\n\nEnterprise readiness through proven production deployments\nDeveloper productivity via faster compile times\nMarket timing as AI workloads demand memory-safe performance\n\nThe combination of memory safety, performance, and ecosystem maturity has proven compelling. With compile times now faster and performance comparable to C++, the business case has written itself.\nBut here's what excites me most: we're still in the early innings. If this is what Rust adoption looks like when the language is still evolving, imagine the landscape in 2026.\nWhat are you building with Rust this year?

Our journey today will take us through the heart of Rust's release process, providing insights and clarifications along the way.\nWhat is the Rust Release Train?\nRust's release train is a model for delivering updates and new features to the language. This model prioritizes consistency, stability, and predictability, ensuring that Rust developers can enjoy new features without worrying about disruptive changes or instability.\nHow It Works\n\nRegular Schedule: The release train operates on a fixed, six-week cycle. Every six weeks, a new stable version of Rust is released. This predictable schedule allows developers to plan for updates and minimizes surprises.\nChannels: Rust employs three primary channels for releases:\n\nStable Channel: This is the official release of Rust that most developers use. It's updated every six weeks and is considered stable and ready for production use.\nBeta Channel: When a new feature is finalized, it enters the beta channel. It stays here for six weeks for further testing before it's promoted to stable.\nNightly Channel: Cutting-edge features that are still in development are available in the nightly channel. While exciting, these features are not guaranteed to be stable or to make it into the stable channel.\n\n\nBackward Compatibility: A key aspect of the release train is its commitment to backward compatibility. New updates aim not to break existing Rust code, ensuring a smooth transition for developers.\n\nBenefits of the Release Train\n\nStability: The regular release schedule and rigorous testing phases mean that new features are thoroughly vetted before reaching the stable channel.\nInnovation: The nightly and beta channels allow for continuous innovation without compromising the stability of the stable channel.\nCommunity Involvement: The Rust community plays a significant role in the development process, contributing to the evolution of the language.\n\nNavigating Updates\nAs a Rust developer, it's essential to keep track of these updates. The official Rust blog is a great resource for staying informed about new releases and upcoming features.\nConclusion\nThe Rust Release Train is a testament to the language's commitment to stability and innovation. By understanding this process, developers can make the most of Rust's powerful features while ensuring their code remains robust and reliable.\nA Deep Dive into the format_args! Macro and fmt::Arguments\n\nThe technical article by Rust Expert Mara Bos, titled \"Behind the Scenes of Rust String Formatting: format_args!()\" offers an in-depth exploration of the fmt::Arguments type in the Rust standard library. This type, along with the format_args!() macro, is a fundamental component behind various text formatting macros such as print!(), format!(), and log::info!(), both from the standard library and community crates.\nIn this article, Bos delves into the workings of fmt::Arguments, its current implementation, and potential future improvements. The article begins by explaining how the format_args!() macro works, highlighting its compile-time parsing of format strings and its ability to produce compiler errors if placeholders and arguments do not match. Bos also discusses the macro's ability to transform string templates into representations that are easy to process at runtime.\nThe article further explores the usage examples of Rust’s string formatting, implementation details, and the private nature of fmt::Arguments implementation, which allows for flexibility in making changes without affecting existing code. Bos raises questions about the most efficient implementation of fmt::Arguments and discusses various aspects such as structure size, code size, and runtime overhead.\nThe article concludes with ideas for improvement, including the use of closures, the introduction of a simple_fmt method in display traits, merging pieces and placeholders, creating a list of formatting instructions, and optimizing the fmt::Arguments structure.\nFor a comprehensive understanding of this topic, you can read the full article at Mara's Blog.\nSnippets\n\nAWS SDK for Rust is now generally available\nloco-rs: releasing a framework inspired by Rails on Rust\n\n\nWe are thrilled to have you as part of our growing community of Rust enthusiasts!

This week, we’re kicking things off with a guide that actually gets you, and no, it doesn’t start with “first, write a memory allocator.” We’ve also got a wild experiment trying to make Rust’s link times faster than your coffee maker. And if you’ve ever dreamed of debugging by jumping back in time, you’re gonna want to see what’s cooking there. So pour something strong, get comfy, and let’s get into it.\nLet’s dive in!\nRust for C Programmers\nAs someone who came into Rust with a C background already under my belt, I found Rust for C Programmers to be a neat project, well thought out and refreshingly to-the-point. It’s a resource that respects your experience, trims the fat, and walks you through Rust’s more mind-bending features without over-explaining the obvious.\nYou can read it online at Rust for C programmers, and it’s entirely free.\nWhat sparked my interest wasn’t just the book itself, but also a recent Reddit thread that brought it back into the spotlight. Folks over at /r/rust had a good mix of appreciation and critique. Some praised the clean structure and practical focus, while others wished it were a bit shorter or included async and macro chapters (which are apparently in the works). It was clear from the comments that the book fills a very real need: bridging the mental model of C with the safety and modern features of Rust.\nThe book itself is around 500 pages, but it reads faster than you’d think. It skips hand-holding and dives straight into how Rust approaches memory, ownership, and lifetimes differently. What I liked most is that it doesn’t try to be an exhaustive Rust encyclopedia. It knows its audience. It skips compiler internals and focuses on what actually matters when you’re coming from a background of malloc, pointers, and structs.\nIf you’re already comfortable with systems-level thinking and want a Rust book that talks your language, this is worth a read. Whether you’re just testing the waters or sharpening your understanding, it hits a nice balance of technical depth and straight talk.\nFaster Linking for Rust: David Lattimore’s Mission to Make Compilation Snappy Again\nWhat if your Rust builds finished before you stood up to get coffee?\nThat’s the vision David Lattimore is chasing. On a self-imposed sabbatical, he’s doing something most developers wouldn’t dare: writing a new Linux linker from scratch, tailored for performance, especially during development cycles. It’s called Wild, and it might just change how fast Rust compiles feel for all of us.\nIn a compelling podcast episode, David walks through the technical motivations behind Wild, how linking really works, and why it remains such a huge bottleneck for Rust builds, especially at the end of a long dependency chain. Meanwhile, the Reddit thread highlights just how excited the community is to finally see an alternative that puts developer speed first.\nWhy Wild matters\nDavid started Wild in late 2023, and is still going strong, aiming for three things:\n\nSpeed: Link times are often the slowest part of the Rust build process. Wild is explicitly built for low-latency, parallelized linking.\nCompatibility: It works today with Clang and supports most real-world linker flags.\nIncrementality: Although not yet implemented, it’s part of the long-term vision to make linking more dynamic and modular.\n\nDespite being early-stage, Wild is already usable. David has been dogfooding it for six months on his own Rust projects. And even better: it’s open source and welcoming contributors.\nTechnical Deep Dives\nThe episode also peels back the curtain on:\n\nWhat a linker actually does (hint: it’s not just fusing binaries).\nWhy debug info bloats memory usage.\nThe intricacies of cross-compilation and relocations.\nWhen to return Result vs. panic! in systems code.\nHow linker flag complexity evolved over decades (and why David ignores most of them unless they’re used in the wild, pun intended).\n\nOne of the most fascinating takeaways: Rust and its ecosystem still rely heavily on C/C++ toolchains at the linking stage. Wild aims to bring some Rust-native speed and modularity to that last mile of compilation.\nTakeaways\n\nWild is real: And already usable if you’re on Linux and can configure your toolchain to use Clang.\nLinking is still a black box for most developers — but it doesn’t have to be.\nRust enables fearless, multithreaded systems programming — Wild’s architecture is a showcase for what Rust makes possible.\nThere’s room to contribute: If you want to help, Wild’s repo is open, and David welcomes contributors.\n\n\n“I want to regain that feeling of spontaneity and instantaneousness in a compiled language like Rust.”\n— David Lattimore\n\nIf you’ve ever waited on a slow cargo build, Wild might be the breath of fresh air you didn’t know you needed. Keep an eye on it and maybe even contribute.\nFireDBG, Rust Debugging, but with a Rewind Button\nI came across a project recently that’s worth your radar: FireDBG, a time-travel visual debugger made specifically for Rust, by the folks over at SeaQL. The idea behind it is simple but powerful—debug your program like it’s a movie. Step forward, step backward, pause, rewind, and see exactly how things played out, all in a structured visual call tree.\nWhat caught my attention is how it tries to solve a real pain point in debugging Rust: context. Not just what went wrong, but how your program got there. FireDBG records execution into a .firedbg.ss file that you can load in Visual Studio Code with their extension. It lets you explore function calls, variable states, and thread activity across the full timeline of a run. And yes, you can go backwards.\nThere’s also a CLI version if you’re not into visual tools, but the VS Code integration seems to be where the main experience is built. They even provide a testbench repo to help you try it out without wiring up your own project first.\nThe GitHub repo shows they’ve put serious thought into it, plenty of documentation, a clean design, and an emphasis on usability. There’s also been some chatter on &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/18fz013/introducing_firedbg_a_time_travel_visual_debugger/\" target=_\"blank\"&gt;/r/rust that echoes the same sentiment: this isn’t just a clever demo. It’s a real attempt at giving Rust developers modern debugging tools.\nEven if you’re not jumping to use it today, it’s the kind of project that pushes Rust tooling in the right direction. Definitely something to keep an eye on, especially if your current debugging strategy still involves a lot of println!.\nSnippets\n\nHow we wrap external C and C++ libraries in Rust\nDesigning Error Types in Rust Libraries\n2,000x faster route propagation by rewriting our Traefik gateway in Rust\n\n\nWe are thrilled to have you as part of our growing community of Rust enthusiasts!

After much deliberation, I'm excited to announce the project we'll be tackling together: **building a drone**. More precisely a Flight Controller. This journey won't just be a personal challenge—I plan to build this project in public, sharing each step of the process to enhance our community's learning and engagement.\nChoosing the Right Framework\nThe first step in this adventure was to decide on the programming environment: RTOS, bare metal, or async programming. While Tock OS, RTic, and Hubris with its accompanying debugger Humility) from Oxide Computer were strong contenders, each offering unique strengths, I decided to embark on a path less traveled within our context.\nGiven my background with the RTOS Zephyr, which is primarily written in C, the allure of exploring new territories was irresistible. I've chosen to work with Embassy, a framework that supports async programming. This choice is particularly exciting as it bridges the gap for those transitioning from high level Web development or Systems Programming to Embedded Development in Rust. The async model in Embassy will help us manage multiple tasks efficiently, which is crucial for controlling a drone's various functions concurrently.\nWhy Not Bare Metal?\nWhile bare metal programming offers direct hardware control and efficiency, it lacks the built-in concept of task prioritization and asynchronous operations—features that are critical for a drone's operational requirements. The complexity of managing a drone's multiple sensors, motors, and safety checks makes bare metal a less suitable option for this project.\nWhat’s Next?\nI am thrilled to start coding, compiling, and flashing the drone. Stay tuned for regular updates, insights, and tutorials in the coming editions of Rust Trends. Together, we'll navigate the challenges and celebrate the milestones of this exciting project.\nLet's soar to new heights with Rust!\nAdventures In Rust: Bringing Exchange Support To Thunderbird\n\nIn the latest post on the Thunderbird blog, the team discusses their adventures in implementing Exchange support using Rust, a journey that marks a significant milestone for Thunderbird. For over two decades, Thunderbird had not introduced support for a new mail protocol, making this development particularly notable. The choice of Rust was driven by several advantages such as memory safety, performance, modularity, and its vibrant ecosystem. Notably, Thunderbird benefits from its integration with Firefox's codebase and infrastructure, which already supports Rust, easing some aspects of development despite the challenges posed by legacy code and architectural hurdles.\nThis endeavor is part of Thunderbird's broader effort to modernize its architecture, addressing technical debts and enhancing maintainability for future expansions. The implementation focuses on interfacing with Microsoft's Exchange Web Services (EWS), utilizing Rust's capabilities to manage complex features and ensure robust security practices. Despite initial challenges with the build system and integrating Rust code, the team has successfully navigated these issues, setting a foundation for further development and integration of Rust within Thunderbird's architecture.\nFor more details on this transformative journey and the technical insights behind it, you can read the full blog post here.\n\nWe are thrilled to have you as part of our growing community of Rust enthusiasts!

We hope this change will better accommodate your busy schedules and provide ample time to read and digest our valuable insights.\nIn this edition, we are focusing on the important topic of security and safety, which is becoming increasingly critical in today’s digital and connected world.\nIn addition to this, we will also be bringing you the latest news and updates from the world of Rust programming, so be sure to read on and stay up to date with the latest developments.\nLet’s dive into today’s topics and discover the latest and greatest in the world of Rust programming!\n\nCould Rust be the ideal language for Secure Systems?\n\nAs a systems programming language, Rust has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its unique ownership and borrowing system that prevents common classes of programming errors such as buffer overflows and data races. This has led to Rust being identified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a safer coding tool.\nIn March 2023, NIST added Rust to its list of Safer Languages on the grounds of its ownership model, which “guarantees both memory safety and thread safety, at compile-time, without requiring a garbage collector.” NIST points out that Rust “allows users to write high-performance code while eliminating many bug classes,” and while Rust does have an “unsafe” mode, the institute explains that risk is mitigated through the narrow scope of actions allowed.\nThe recent hacking of the Tesla Model 3 at the Pwn2Own contest, in under 2 minutes, highlights the importance of secure coding practices, particularly in safety-critical applications such as those in the automotive industry. This contest was organized by the Zero Day Initiative.\nRust’s safety features make it an ideal language for developing secure systems, but there is one major hurdle to overcome before it can be widely adopted in these applications: ISO 26262 compliance.\nISO 26262 is an international standard for functional safety in the automotive industry that sets requirements for the development of safety-critical systems. Rust is not currently ISO 26262 compliant, but Ferrous Systems aims to develop a safety-critical subset of the language that meets the standard’s requirements. If successful, this could make Rust a more attractive option for developing secure systems in the automotive industry and other safety-critical applications.\nIn conclusion, Rust’s unique features make it a safer coding tool than traditional programming languages, and its potential for use in safety-critical applications is significant. With ongoing efforts to bring Rust up to standard, it could become the ideal language for developing secure systems in the future. The recent recognition of Rust’s safety features by NIST, combined with the need for secure coding practices highlighted by the Tesla Model 3 hack, reinforces the importance of prioritizing security in software development.\n\nRust in Space and Beyond\nAnother area for safety-critical application is space. Tweede Golf, a member of the Rust Foundation, gave a presentation on Rust to the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre.\nAdditionally, since the SpaceX launch of 3 January 2023, French company Gama has had a test satellite in orbit that runs largely on Rust software. \nBuild System made in Rust\nMeta, the social media company behind Facebook, has announced the release of their new open-source build system called Buck2. Buck2 is designed to improve the build experience for developers and make it faster and more efficient.\nIn Meta’s internal tests, Buck2 completed builds two times faster than its predecessor, Buck1, written in Java. Buck2 is written in Rust, and its design is based on principles that include a complete separation of core and language-specific rules, increased parallelism, integration with remote execution and virtual file systems, and a redesigned console output.\nThe open-source release of Buck2 is almost identical to the internal version, with the only differences being the toolchains and remote execution, which have open-source alternatives supplied. Buck2 also supports virtual file systems, making it faster and more efficient.\nIn real-world usage, Buck2 is significantly faster than Buck1, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to speed up their builds. Thousands of developers at Meta are already using Buck2, performing millions of builds per day, with hopes that the wider industry will see benefits as well.\nSnippets\n\nTwitter open-sourced its stack, these are the parts that use Rust.

They believe Android’s ongoing shift from memory-unsafe to memory-safe languages is a major factor.\nThere is a strong correlation between the use of Rust and the decrease in vulnerabilities found. Note that correlation is not causation, but there is strong evidence like:\nTo date, there have been zero memory safety vulnerabilities discovered in Android’s Rust code.\nWant to read more head over to their security blog.\n\n \n\nA port scanner in Rust\n\n\n \nA well-known port scanner is Nmap (Network mapper). Did you know there is a (faster) Rust alternative called RustScan? To be fair it uses Nmap under the hood but utilizes multiple threads to speed up scanning.\nThe well-maintained repository of RustScan can be found here.\nYou can run Rustscan also in a Docker image.

GreptimeDB employs the snafu crate to manage its extensive error ecosystem, creating custom error types for each module while maintaining a unified strategy. This approach enables detailed error stacks that record precise locations and causes—something more contextual than a typical backtrace.\nFor example:\n\nNotably, GreptimeDB’s approach coexists with other popular Rust error-handling crates. thiserror simplifies custom error implementations, while anyhow offers a convenient “catch-all” solution for apps prioritizing simplicity. Each serves different needs, but GreptimeDB’s snafu integration exemplifies fine-grained control over complex scenarios.\nKey Takeaways:\n\nError Context Matters: Detailed error stacks save debugging time by showing where and why failures occur.\nKnow Your Tools: The choice of snafu, thiserror, or anyhow depends on project complexity and team needs—mix wisely for balance.\n\nError-handling strategy isn’t just about fixing bugs; it’s about empowering both developers and end-users with clarity and precision.\nFrom C to Safe Rust: How a New Paper Could Revolutionize Code Migration\nA recent paper, “Compiling C to Safe Rust, Formalized” by Aymeric Fromherz and Jonathan Protzenko, delves into the complexities of translating C code into safe Rust.\nThe authors present a type-directed translation method that converts a subset of C into safe Rust, ensuring the resulting code complies with Rust’s stringent safety guarantees without relying on unsafe constructs. A notable innovation is their static analysis technique, “split trees,” which effectively maps C’s pointer arithmetic to Rust’s slices and splitting operations.\nApplying this methodology to formally verified C codebases, such as the HACL cryptographic library and EverParse’s binary parsers, they successfully generated pure Rust codebases without the use of unsafe code. This effort resulted in an 80,000-line verified cryptographic library in Rust, implementing modern algorithms without a single use of unsafe.\nThis research highlights the feasibility of migrating critical C codebases to Rust, enhancing memory safety and security while preserving performance and formal verification assurances.\nFor those interested in the technical details, for the full paper click here.\nAn ongoing discussion&nbsp;about this paper is taking place on Hacker News.\nThis work underscores the potential for automated tools to facilitate the transition from C to Rust, promoting safer and more secure software development practices.\nSnippets\n\nRebuilding an algorithmic trading platform in Rust\nRustlab Conference Youtube videos\nGreat Youtube explainer on Lifetimes\n\n\nWe are thrilled to have you as part of our growing community of Rust enthusiasts!

This week we're diving into error organization (because yes, there's actually a right way to do it). Plus, bzip2 goes full-Rust and the compiler team wants your performance feedback.\nLet's jump in.\nDeep Dive – Organizing Errors Without Losing Your Mind\nLet's be honest, Rust's error system is powerful, but once your project gets big, it can turn into spaghetti. Two great writeups tackle this: Sabrina Jewson shares how to modularize errors in medium-sized codebases, and Sylvain Kerkour dives into managing errors across large, multi-crate systems.\nThe Problem\nA single Error enum for everything starts out fine… until it bloats. You lose context, leak internal details, and tightly couple your modules. Suddenly, moving one module breaks everything.\nSabrina's Approach: Modular Errors\nKeep errors local. Each module defines its own error enum. Only expose higher-level errors at public boundaries.\nWhy it works:\n\nKeeps context specific\nAvoids leaky abstractions\nEncourages clean, reusable modules\n\nTakeaway: Let your modules own their errors. It's like keeping tools in the right drawer.\nSylvain's Approach: Scalable Crate-Level Errors\nFor bigger systems, define per-crate errors and bubble them up with context using tools like snafu.\nWhy it works:\n\nMaintains backtrace and call context\nKeeps crate boundaries clean\nScales well with many moving parts\n\nTakeaway: Wrap errors up the stack with context. Your future self debugging a production issue will thank you.\nMy 3 Key Takeaways:\n\nStart modular: Even small projects benefit from localized error types\nScale with context: Use crates like snafu or thiserror to add clarity without boilerplate\nErrors are architecture: Clean error design helps you reason about your system as a whole\n\nGot a project that's growing fast? This is the moment to invest in smart error handling—it'll save you hours later.\nbzip2 Goes All-Rust\nThe bzip2 crate just dropped C and went full-Rust with version 0.6.0, thanks to the Trifecta Tech Foundation. Under the hood, it now defaults to libbz2-rs-sys—a pure Rust reimplementation. The old C version? Still there if you need it, but Rust is the new default.\nWhy This Rocks\n\nFaster: Compression is ~10–15% quicker, decompression ~5–10%. Real, measurable gains\nCross-compilation friendly: No more dealing with C toolchains. WebAssembly, Android, Windows, it all just works\nClean &amp; Safe: MIRI-compliant, symbol-safe, and audited by Radically Open Security\n\nIf your project depends on .bz2, this update gives you speed, simplicity, and less C-induced pain. It's a drop-in upgrade with real perks.\nWhat I love here is how this project takes a crusty old C tool and gives it new life in Rust, without breaking things or adding complexity. It's a solid reminder that \"rewrite in Rust\" can actually work—especially when done with care.\nCommunity Call – Rust Compiler Performance Survey 2025\nRust compile times still too slow for your taste? Now's your chance to help fix that. The Rust team just launched the 2025 Compiler Performance Survey, and they want your feedback on how rustc performs in the real world.\nIt's quick (about 10 minutes), totally anonymous, and open until July 7.

By leveraging Cargo's capabilities, developers can streamline their workflow, ensure code quality, and manage dependencies more effectively. This article explores essential Cargo commands and tools that every Rust programmer should know including cargo-minify, cargo-fmt, cargo-fix, cargo-audit, cargo-udeps, and several other popular tools.\nCargo clippy\nAn advanced linter for Rust, providing a comprehensive set of lints to help improve your Rust code\nCargo fmt\nConsistency is key in any large codebase. cargo fmt uses Rustfmt to format your Rust code according to style guidelines. It ensures that your project's code style remains consistent, which is vital for collaborative projects and maintaining code clarity.\nCargo minify\ncargo-minify is an invaluable tool for reducing the size of your Rust binaries. It optimizes the final build, stripping unnecessary data and compressing the code without affecting functionality. This is especially crucial for applications where binary size is a concern, such as embedded systems or distributed applications.\nCargo fix\ncargo fix automatically applies suggestions from the Rust compiler to fix warnings and improve your code. This command is particularly helpful during the upgrade of Rust editions, ensuring your codebase is up-to-date with the latest language features and idioms.\nCargo audit\nSecurity is paramount, and cargo audit helps identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. This tool checks your Cargo.lock file against the RustSec Advisory Database and alerts you to any security issues in the dependencies. Can be easily installed with \"cargo install cargo-audit\".\nCargo udeps\nUnused dependencies that bloat your project, cargo udeps helps in detecting unused dependencies in your Cargo.toml, enabling you to maintain a lean codebase. This means you only need the nightly Rust for running this specific tool, while the rest of your development and production process can remain on the stable release.\nCargo unused-features\nSimilar to cargo udeps, cargo unused-features focuses on identifying unused features of dependencies within your project. It's a great way to keep your codebase clean and efficient. Can be easily installed  with \"cargo install cargo-unused-features\".\nConclusion\nCargo is more than a package manager; it's a comprehensive tool that supports various aspects of Rust development.

A quote from the Rust Language Book “Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, so it’s important to understand how ownership works.”\nMost design decisions in Rust do not leave room for interpretation, which forces good programming habits. Characteristics like Strongly typed, immutable variables by default, ownership, safe concurrency, etc, make Rust one of the safest languages and removes possible security vulnerabilities and bugs in your code. Most of it happens at compile time, which is way better than in production at runtime.\nBlockchains and Rust\nBlockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin and many other decentralized digital currencies, benefits from a secure language like Rust.\nThere are at least five well-known blockchains using Rust as their primary language. The most popular ones are Solana and Polkadot. To see all five blockchains click here.

Let’s dive in …\nIn today’s email:\n\nRust + WebAssembly = Web + Speed\nComprehensive Rust, want to learn Rust?\nNote-taking app the Rust alternative for Notion\n\nRust + WebAssembly = Web + Speed\nWebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary format for running code in web browsers that has gained a lot of traction in the last few years. It allows developers to run code written in languages other than JavaScript, such as C++ or Rust, in the browser, enabling the creation of more complex and performant web applications.\nRust has a number of features that make it especially suited for compiling to Wasm, including a focus on performance and safety, a strong type system, and low-level control over memory. 2 minutes Youtube intro by Let’s Get Rusty.\nUsing Rust and WebAssembly together allows developers to take advantage of Rust’s strengths while still being able to run their code in the browser. This can be useful for applications that need to perform computationally intensive tasks, such as image or video processing, scientific simulations, or data visualization. A real-world example is the all-in-one design program Figma. Note that Figma uses C++ but could also have been Rust.\nOverall, Rust and WebAssembly offer a lot of potential for building high-performance and reliable web applications. As more developers start using this combination, we can expect to see even more exciting and innovative applications built with Rust and Wasm. Looking for more examples check this out: Made with WebAssembly.\nComprehensive Rust, want to learn Rust?\nComprehensive Rust is a 4-day course developed by the Google Android team. Only the fourth day is Android specific, for the rest a nice generic course to follow for starters.\nThis course comes with a GitHub repository\nIn a previous newsletter, we also highlighted that Android was using Rust and that they saw a steep decline in vulnerabilities.\nNote-taking app the Rust alternative for Notion\nAppFlowy.io calls itself the open-source alternative to Notion. They started in November 2021 and have got a lot of traction from the beginning.\nIt is written in Rust and Flutter and has been one of the trending GitHub repositories.\nIf you are looking for a free and good note-taking app, for sure give it a try.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy your Sunday, and have a great week ahead.\nThanks for reading!\nBob Peters\nFeel free to connect with me on LinkedIn\n","id":"https://rust-trends.com/newsletter/webassembly-and-rust-learning-rust-and-be-ready-to-take-notes/","title":"8 - WebAssembly and Rust, learning Rust, and be ready to take notes"},"https://rust-trends.com/newsletter/why-rust-trends/":{"body":"Rust is a popular system programming language, and according to the yearly Stack Overflow developer survey most loved programming language since 2015.

Started thoughts of rewriting their C stack back in 2017, because of the low development speed. Combined with Rust being less error-prone and providing better secure programming methods it is a clear match. Read more about the official release on the Tor Blog.\nRust for Microcontrollers\n\nRust’s popularity is also spreading towards Embedded Systems. I came across this nice project called Wokwi that provides several simulators, one of which is a simulation that runs your Rust code on an ESP32. You can attach several devices like LEDs, sensors, and displays without the need of heating up your soldering Iron\nUnreal game engine a Rust add-on\n\n  \n    There are already some game engines completely written in Rust but are not yet mainstream. Maik Klein started to go at it via another route. An add-on to the Unreal Game engine that allows you to write in Rust. Note it is currently still a proof of concept.\nOne important take away the editor for the Unreal Engine supports Hot Reloading while editing, however, with C++, the original language for the Engine, you can easily trigger a crash of the editor by e.g. accessing a null pointer. “In Rust crashes or panic are well defined and can be caught.

That’s where cargo-generate steps in, acting as a versatile project templating tool that streamlines the setup of Rust projects with custom templates.\nWhat is cargo-generate?\ncargo-generate is a developer tool that enables you to create new Rust projects from existing templates stored in Git repositories. By leveraging these templates, you can quickly scaffold projects that include predefined configurations, dependencies, and file structures tailored to your needs.\nWhy Use cargo-generate?\n\nConsistency Across Projects: By using templates, you ensure that all your projects start with a consistent structure and configuration, reducing setup errors and saving time.\nSimplified Setup for Complex Configurations: For projects that require additional files like build.rs, rust-toolchain.toml, or .cargo/config.toml, common in embedded development, cargo-generate includes these files out of the box, which cargo new or cargo init do not provide.\nCustomization Through Placeholders and Hooks: Templates can define placeholders and hooks, allowing you to customize aspects of the project during generation, such as naming conventions or enabling specific features.\n\nGetting Started with cargo-generate\nInstall cargo-generate using Cargo:\n\nGenerating a New Project:\nUse cargo-generate with a template repository:\n\nYou’ll be prompted to provide details like the project name and other template-specific options.\nTakeaways\nIncorporating cargo-generate into your workflow can significantly enhance productivity, especially for projects with specialized requirements. By automating the inclusion of necessary configuration files and ensuring a consistent project structure, it allows you to focus more on development and less on setup.\nFor embedded Rust projects, where additional configuration files are often essential, cargo-generate proves to be an invaluable tool, simplifying the setup process and ensuring that all necessary components are in place from the start.\nSo, the next time you’re about to start a new Rust project, consider whether cargo-generate can help you hit the ground running with a tailored template.\nFor more information see the Github repository of cargo generate\nWhy Every Rust Developer Should Know About&nbsp;Deps.rs\nManaging dependencies in Rust projects can be a daunting task, especially when ensuring that all are up-to-date and free from security vulnerabilities.

To install dig, run:\n\nLater on we will explain how to use the dig tool to test our DNS server.\nUnderstanding DNS: A Quick Crash Course\nA DNS request involves:\n\nA client (like your browser) sending a DNS query to a server.\nThe server responds with an IP address (or forwards the query).\nThe client uses that IP to establish a connection.\n\nDNS messages are encoded as binary data to ensure efficient transmission over the network. This means we will be working with raw bytes rather than plain text. A request typically includes:\n\nHeader: Contains metadata.\nQuestion: The domain name being queried.\nAnswer (in response): The resolved IP address.\n\nThe full specification is available in RFC 1035 I’ll refer to it throughout this article and highlight the most relevant chapters. If you want a step-by-step walkthrough of the DNS protocol, I recommend this article.\nOne of the great things about Rust is its strong type system, which allows us to define structures that closely resemble the DNS message format as specified in RFC 1035.\nSetting Up the Project\nLet’s create a Rust project for our DNS server:\n\nOpen your preferred text editor and navigate to the project directory. If you’re looking for a recommendation, Zed is a great option.\nNow, open Cargo.toml and add dependencies:\n\nAnother way of doing the same is using cargo add in the project directory:\n\nClap is a powerful and intuitive command-line argument parser for Rust, supporting subcommands, flags, options, and arguments.\nThiserror is a lightweight crate for defining custom error types with Rust’s Error trait.\nNow let's start writing our DNS server...\nDefining DNS Header structure\nTo handle a DNS request, we first need to define the structure of a DNS message. Let’s start by defining the DNS Header in a separate file called dns.rs. The DNS header structure is defined in RFC 1035 - 4.1.1.\n\nYou do not need to know the meaning of each field in the DNS header. The fields are used by the DNS protocol to indicate the type of message, the status of the message, and the number of resource records in each section of the message among other things.\nSince DNS messages are transmitted as raw binary data, we need to convert our Header struct into a byte array (serialization). When receiving a DNS request, we perform deserialization to reconstruct the Header from raw bytes.\nNote that network byte order is big-endian (be) hence our use of the function u16::to_be_bytes() and u16::from_be_bytes().\n\nSince we added an Error type to the deserialization function we need to include thiserror and define them. I will define the ErrorCondition enum at the top of the file.\n\nNow we are going to implement the main loop where we will receive DNS queries from clients and send back responses. To start, we’ll implement a simple DNS server that decodes the DNS header and prints the query.\n\nOur current code contains several expect calls, which we’ll refine later. This exemplifies one of Rust’s key strengths: explicit error handling, ensuring that nothing is left to implicit behavior.\nIn the main function, we create a UDP socket bound to port 1053 and initialize a 512-byte buffer. We then print a message indicating that the DNS server is running. Inside the loop, the server listens for incoming requests, parses the DNS header, and prints the query details, continuously processing requests until stopped with Ctrl+C.\nNow, let’s run the server! Open a terminal and start the DNS server: cargo run. Open another terminal and run dig @localhost -p 1053 rust-trends.com\nSince we have not implemented DNS query processing, dig won’t receive a valid response. Instead, it may retry a few times before giving up. Because UDP is an unreliable protocol, dig simply attempts the query again if no response is received.\nExample output from our server:\n\nCode for this part can be found in the Github Repository under step 1.\nWow! We’re running a DNS server in Rust! Are you curious how the rest of the request looks like? Let's print it out!\nPrinting the DNS Request\nBefore parsing the full DNS request, let’s first inspect the raw data. The function below prints the incoming bytes in a structured hex format, similar to how hex editors display binary files. This helps us visualize the request and debug potential issues.\nIf you’ve done low-level programming before, you’re probably familiar with hex editors. It has a convenient layout of printing bytes. An example of such a great editor can be found at hexed.it\nLet’s take inspiration from this and extend main.rs to print the DNS request.\n\nNow, let’s run the server and send a DNS request using dig dig @localhost -p 1053 rust-trends.com.\n\nEach line in the output represents 16 bytes of the request. The first column is the byte offset (e.g., 00000000). The next columns show the hexadecimal values of the bytes. Finally, the rightmost column prints the ASCII representation of printable characters, replacing non-printable bytes with dots (.).\nThis debug information is useful for understanding the DNS request. Did you notice the quirk where z is set to 2? It's a reserved field that can be used for future extensions and was expected to be zero. Huh!? What's that about? You can read more about it at StackExchange. Apperently RFC's get amended. For now, we’ll ignore it and move on....\nSince the DNS header is always 12 bytes, and our total request length is 44 bytes, we can infer that the remaining 32 bytes correspond to the Question Section. Next, we’ll decode it to extract the domain name being queried.\nCode for this part can be found in the Github Repository under step 1.\nDefining the DNS Question Structure\nIn the Domain Name System (DNS), a question is a structured query that specifies the domain name and the type of record being requested. This structure is fundamental to DNS resolution and is formally defined in RFC 1035, Section 4.1.2.\nA DNS question consists of three fields:\n\nQNAME: The domain name being queried, represented as a sequence of labels. Each label is encoded as a length-prefixed string, and the entire name is terminated with a zero byte.\nQTYPE: Specifies the type of DNS record being requested (e.g., A for IPv4 addresses, AAAA for IPv6 addresses, MX for mail exchange records).\nQCLASS: Indicates the class of the query, with the most common value being IN (Internet).\n\nQNAME Encoding Details\nDNS uses a compact encoding for domain names:\n1.\tEach label (e.g., “www”, “rust-trends”, “com”) is prefixed by a single byte indicating its length.\n2.\tLabels are concatenated sequentially.\n3.\tThe entire sequence is terminated with a zero byte (0x00).\nExample DNS Question for www.rust-trends.com\nA DNS query for www.rust-trends.com requesting an A record (IPv4 address) in the Internet class would be structured as follows:\nQNAME Encoding\nThe domain name \"www.rust-trends.com\" is split into labels:\n•\t\"www\" → 3 characters\n•\t\"rust-trends\" → 11 characters\n•\t\"com\" → 3 characters\nDNS encoding rules:\n•\tEach label is prefixed by its length as a single byte.\n•\tThe entire domain is terminated with a 0x00 byte.\nEncoded QNAME:\n\nBreaking it down:\n-\t03 → Length of \"www\", followed by ASCII 77 77 77 (www).\n-\t0B → Length of \"rust-trends\", followed by ASCII 72 75 73 74 2D 74 72 65 6E 64 73 (rust-trends).\n-\t03 → Length of \"com\", followed by ASCII 63 6F 6D (com).\n-\t00 → End of QNAME.\nComplete DNS Question Structure\nA complete DNS question includes:\n-\tQNAME → Encoded domain name.\n-\tQTYPE → 00 01 (A record).\n-\tQCLASS → 00 01 (Internet class).\nFinal binary representation:\n\nThis is how a DNS client would structure a query to resolve www.rust-trends.com into an IPv4 address.\nHow should we structure this? Instead of storing the domain name as a single string, we break it down into its individual labels (e.g., www, rust-trends, com). This allows for more efficient processing when serializing and handling compressed DNS messages later. We can represent QTYPE and QCLASS as enums.\n\nFor the Types we can look at section 3.2.3 and section 3.2.2 of the RFC. Note that Types used in Resource Records are a subset of Types used in Questions, so for sake of simplicity we will use the same enum for both.\n\nFinally, we define the QCLASS enum, as described in section 3.2.4, we will only be using the Internet class, but for the sake of completeness, we will add the other values in the enum:\n\nLet's add the functionality to and deserialize the Question part of DNS query:\n\nThe code uses functions to serialize and deserialize Type (field qtype) and Class (field qclass) into bytes and back into their respective types, requiring proper implementation for from_bytes and to_bytes see below.\n\nWe have all the plumbing in place to deserialize the question, we need to modify main.rs to handle the incoming DNS queries and print them.\n\nNow that we can deserialize both the Header and Question, let’s restart the server and send a DNS request to observe the deserialization in action.\n\n\nCode for this part can be found in the Github Repository under step 2.\nWe see the label sequence and Question struct. We still do not have an answer for this DNS request so next we are going to implement a reply.\nDefining DNS Answer structure\nThe answer section in a DNS query reply is also called a Resource record. It includes several fields, such as the domain name, time-to-live (TTL), the Type and Class we previously defined for the question part and the actual data, which can contain an IP address or other relevant information. Below you can find the structure in code:\n\nWith the above method, we can easily construct a ResourceRecord as part of the reply. Ready to answer the query?\nConstructing a (hardcoded) reply\nA valid DNS response consists of three main parts:\n\nHeader: Includes metadata, response flags, and record counts.\n\nQuestion: Echoes the original query back to the client.\nAnswer: Contains the resolved IP address for the requested domain.\n\n\n\nFor now, our server will always return the fixed IP address 172.67.221.148 when queried for www.rust-trends.com.\nWe will use Rust’s Default trait to define a default ResourceRecord. This provides a simple and reusable way to hardcode a response for now.\n\nNext, we adapt main.rs to send a response. We need to add the ResourceRecord in the use statement.\n\nAfter printing the query, we construct the response.\n\nCode for this part can be found in the Github Repository under step 3.\nOur response reuses some fields from the incoming query but updates specific values:\n- qr = true → Indicates this is a response.\n- rcode = 0 (or 4 for unsupported opcode) → Specifies success or failure.\n- ancount = 1 → Indicates that one answer is included.\nThe deserialized question is re-serialized and included in the response. This ensures that the client can match the response to its original query.\nA complete DNS response consists of:\n\nHeader – Metadata and response flags\nQuestion – Echoed back from the request\nAnswer – The resolved IP address or relevant data\n\nNote: including the question section in the response is a standard part of the DNS protocol, allowing clients to verify the response corresponds to their request.\nLast step is putting it in one byte array and sending it to the client.\nNow let's test our DNS server! Fire up dig and start the server\n\n\nAnd looking at the dig output:\n\nWow it works! we can see it received the header, query and answer. Also note is show a warning about recursion requested but not available. By default, dig requests recursion, but our server does not perform recursive queries. The warning WARNING: recursion requested but not availablesimply indicates that recursion was requested but not supported. To remove this warning, use: dig @localhost -p 1053 www.rust-trends.com +norecurse.\nYou got your reply and can visit www.rust-trends.com.\nConclusion\nWe are coming to the end of Part 1 of this series. You've built a basic DNS server that can parse queries and return a hardcoded IP address. In the next part we will add support for DNS decompression and send the request to a resolver, collect the response, and construct a reply to the client.\nThis tutorial is inspired by the Codecrafters challenge of building your own DNS server.

In this guide, we will build a simple honeypot—a minimal TCP server in Rust that listens on a specific port and logs every incoming request—then deploy it to an Ubuntu instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for FREE. A honeypot offers a fascinating window into the malicious scans and attacks traveling the internet while also providing a playful way to practice coding, cross-compiling, and network configuration. By following these steps, you will gain valuable Rust experience, learn how to set up OCI for external traffic, and come away with deeper insight into real-world attack patterns.\n\nNote 1: I am using a Apple M1 Pro MacBook for development and cross-compiling for x86_64 architecture.\n\n\n1. Prerequisites\nWelcome to the warm-up lap before our Rust honeypot grand adventure! Here’s what you need to get started:\n1.1 Oracle Cloud Account\nFirst things first: snag an Oracle Cloud account (free is our favorite price). The Always Free tier is pretty sweet since it gives you a no-cost VM to play around with. Perfect for deploying a honeypot without emptying your wallet.\n\nNote 1: you can of course use any cloud provider or your own server for this project. But Oracle Cloud offers an \"Always Free\" tier that allows you to run a small VM at no cost and I was looking for an excuse to try it out. Initially I was interested in the ARM architecture but those are limited in my region of choice so I am using a AMD64 instance for this project.\n\n1.2 Ubuntu VM in OCI\nGo to the Oracle Cloud console and spin up an Ubuntu instance. Make sure you’ve got your SSH key set up and can actually get in. Some additional information on how to use SSH can be found in the Oracle Cloud documentation.\n1.3 Rust Installed Locally\nIf you do not have Rust installed look here for the basic setup steps. To add another architecture Rust up your local environment with the following:\n\nPersonally I am using stable-aarch64-apple-darwin on an Apple Silicon Mac for development and cross-compilation.\nBecause I wanted to cross-compile to x86_64 the architecture of AMD64 (a usual suspect for cloud VMs), I installed this handy toolchain:\n\nIf your setup is different, fear not—just make sure you have some way to compile your Rust code into a binary that your Ubuntu server recognizes.\n1.4 Basic Terminal / SSH Skills\nBrush up on your command line wizardry and SSH know-how. If you can SSH into your server, open files in your favorite terminal editor you’re set! If you are not there yet, no worries—there are plenty of tutorials out there to help you get up to speed, e.g. here.\n\n2. Coding the Honeypot in Rust\n2.1 Project Setup\nTo get started, we’ll create a fresh Rust project for our honeypot:\n\nThis initializes a new folder named honeypot containing your basic Cargo scaffolding. For a minimal approach, we won’t require any external crates at this stage—plain Rust’s standard library has all we need for simple socket listening and logging. Below is an example Cargo.toml you might use:\n\nThat’s it, no dependencies listed because Rust’s standard library already includes the core networking (std::net) and concurrency (std::thread) features we need for this basic honeypot. Of course, if you decide to add extra functionality (like logging libraries, async runtimes, or protocol parsers), this is where you’d specify them under [dependencies].\nNext, open src/main.rs, and you will find a bare-bones “Hello, world!” file. We will soon replace that with our honeypot logic.\n2.2 Minimal TCP Server Code\nHere’s a simple TCP server that listens on port 2222, for every connection a thread is spawned. Each thread logs incoming data to a file and stdout.\n\n2.2.1 Handling Connections\nEach incoming connection is handled in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main loop. This way, the honeypot can handle multiple connections simultaneously. The handle_client function reads data from the incoming stream, logs it to a file, and prints it to the console. The get_epoch_time function generates a timestamp for the log file name.\nThe TcpListener is bound to 0.0.0.0:2222, which means it listens on all available network interfaces on port 2222. This allows the honeypot to accept connections from any IP address. The listener.incoming() method returns an iterator over incoming connections (infinitely), which we loop over to handle each connection. Great job! You’ve set up your first TCP listener.\nThe TcpStream represents the connection to a client. We use stream.peer_addr() to get the IP address of the client. If the address is successfully retrieved, we convert it to a string; otherwise, we use \"Unknown\". We then create a buffer to read data from the stream and a file to log the incoming data.\n2.2.2 Logging Data\nThe handle_client function reads data from the stream into the buffer and writes it to the log file. If the read operation returns 0 bytes, the connection is closed, and the function breaks out of the loop. We use String::from_utf8_lossy to convert the buffer to a string, handling invalid UTF-8 sequences gracefully. This allows us to log binary data like �, as well as text.\n2.3 Enhancing the Honeypot\nThis can be extended in many ways, for example, you could add a banner to mimic a real service, or you could add a database to store the logs. Adding more ports, or even emulating a specific protocol. But for now, this is a good starting point.\n\n3. Building and Packaging\n3.1 Native vs. Cross-Compilation\nSince we want to deploy our honeypot on an Ubuntu AMD64 server, we need to compile our Rust code for the x86_64 architecture. If your development machine has the same architecture, you can compile natively cargo build --release. Otherwise, you’ll need to cross-compile for the target architecture. It is one of the benefits of Rust that it is easy to cross-compile.\nIn my case, I am using an Apple M1 Pro MacBook, so I need to cross-compile for x86_64. Here’s how you can do it:\n\nThis creates a binary optimized for the x86_64 architecture, which you can then transfer to your Ubuntu server. It is located in target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/honeypot.\nWhy not use the debug build? The debug build includes additional symbols and debugging information, making the binary larger and slower. The release build is optimized for performance and size, making it more suitable for deployment.\n3.2 Testing Locally\nBefore deploying to Oracle Cloud, you can test your honeypot locally. Build it and run it with cargo run --release the binary on your development machine and connect to it using telnet localhost 2222 or nc localhost 2222. You should see the connection logs in your terminal and a new log file created in the current directory.\n\n4. Deploying to Oracle Cloud\n4.1 Orcale Cloud Infrastructure Network Configuration\nBy default, Oracle Cloud blocks inbound traffic on custom ports. You need to create an Ingress Rule in the Security List or Network Security Group for your instance’s subnet. Example: Open port 2222 to 0.0.0.0/0 via TCP.\n\nGo to the Oracle Cloud console and navigate to your instance\nOpen your instance’s VNIC details\nClick on the Security Lists or Network Security Groups link\nAdd a new Ingress Rule to allow traffic on port 2222 from 0.0.0.0/0 this is not recommended for production, but for a honeypot it is fine. This notation is called CIDR and it means all IP addresses.\nSave the changes and wait for them to take effect.\n\nAdditional tip is to close the actual SSH port on 22 after you have deployed and tested the honeypot service, so that attackers aren’t attempting to brute-force your \"real\" SSH port.\n4.2 Uploading the Honeypot Binary\nTo upload the binary to the server, you can use scp or a deployment script. I choose to use a deployment script to automate the process, because I will be doing this multiple times.\n\nThis script automates the process of building the binary, uploading it to the server, and running an installation script. You can customize it to fit your needs.\n4.3 Installation Script\nCreate an installation script to set up the honeypot on the server. Here’s an example script that installs the honeypot as a systemd service. It’s idempotent, meaning you can run it multiple times without causing issues.\n\nThis script installs the honeypot binary, creates a systemd service, and starts the service. It also ensures that the service is stopped before updating the binary or service file. The service logs are written to /var/log/honeypot.log and /var/log/honeypot_err.log.\nThe binary is run under the privileges of the honeypot user, which is created if it doesn’t exist. The honeypot binary is copied to /opt/honeypot, and the systemd service file is created or updated. The service is then reloaded, enabled, and restarted.\nA pro-tip I got from Daniel Thompson-Yvetot was to assume the box will be powned and to make it more interesting for the attacker. For example, you change the name of the honeypot sevice to fastxmrminer.service and the binary to fastxmrminer and the attacker will think they hit the jackpot.\nIn the current version I kept it simple and straightforward for educational purposes, but you can expand on this idea.\n\n5. Testing and Monitoring\n5.1 Live Logs\nYou can monitor the honeypot logs in real-time using tail -f. Here’s how to check the logs:\n\nSSH into your server.\nUse tail -f /var/log/honeypot.log to monitor incoming requests.\nUse tail -f /var/log/honeypot_err.log to monitor errors.\n\nI separated the logs to make it easier to distinguish between regular logs and errors. You can customize the log paths and contents to suit your needs.\nThe stderr could benefit from structured logging or tracing, but for this simple honeypot, we’ll keep it basic.\n5.2 Simulating an Attack\nYou can test your honeypot by connecting to it using telnet or nc from your local machine. Here’s how:\n\nFrom your local machine, run telnet &lt;server_ip&gt; 2222 or nc &lt;server_ip&gt; 2222 to connect to the honeypot.\nEnter some random text and press Enter.\nCheck the logs on the server to see the incoming request.\n\n5.3 Gathering Intelligence\nOver time, your honeypot will encounter a variety of malicious activities, including port scans, SSH brute-force attempts, and automated exploit scripts. By storing these logs for analysis, you can gain valuable insights into who’s probing your system and what they’re attempting to achieve.\nSetting up alerts or notifications can help you identify specific patterns in real-time. Tools like the ELK Stack or Splunk are excellent for log analysis and can be configured to trigger alerts based on defined criteria.\nFor example, I observed numerous SSH brute-force attempts and port scans targeting my honeypot. It was fascinating to watch the diversity of attacks unfold in real time. One notable instance involved a “Makiko” client—a Rust-based SSH client—attempting to connect, showcasing that Rust is also being utilized for malicious purposes. Shortly after, I detected a Go-based client attempting to connect as well—although, admittedly, Go might not be the ideal language for this kind of job :)\n\nConclusion\nDeploying a custom Rust honeypot on an always-free Oracle Cloud instance gives you hands-on insight into real-world malicious activity. You’ve learned how to code a simple TCP server in Rust, configure Oracle’s networking, manage an OCI's firewall, and centralize logging.

Its promise of performance, robustness, and safety has made it a top choice for everything from system-level software to web development.\nOne of the pillars in application and web development is the ability to interact seamlessly with databases. Whether you are working on a small-scale utility tool, a web API, or an enterprise-grade application, odds are you'll need to store, retrieve, or manipulate data in a database. That is where Rust's rich ecosystem of libraries, commonly referred to as 'crates', comes into play.\nIn this article we focus on three crates that standout for an relational SQL database: Diesel, SQLx, and Tokio-Postgres. Each of these offers a distinct set of features, optimizations, and trade-offs, making them popular for different scenarios and requirements.\nIf you are a Rust developer wondering which database crate to choose for your next project, you've come to the right place. This article will dive into these three top contenders, comparing them on various factors such as:\n\nEase of use\nPerformance\nFeatures\nCommunity support\n\nBy the end, you'll have the information you need to make an informed decision for your next Rust project.\nWhy Database Crates Matter\nIn today's interconnected, data-driven world, the database is often considered the backbone of any software application. As developers, our interaction with databases is so frequent that the quality of the tools we use for this interaction can significantly impact not just the development process, but also the performance and reliability of the application itself. That is why choosing the database crate is crucial.\n\nImportance in Application Development\nType Safety\nRust is known for its strong emphasis on type safety and is therefore statically typed, and a great database crate extends this safety. A mistake in a database query can lead to runtime errors or, worse, data corruption. Compile-time SQL verification minimizes these risks, and speed up the feedback cycle.\nPerformance\nDatabase operations can often be a bottleneck in application performance. A well-optimized database library can make efficient use of resources, enabling your application to run faster and handle more users. This is what we expect from a Rust application.\nDeveloper Productivity\nA great database library provides a clean, understandable API that aligns with the language's idioms. This not only makes it easier to write code but also makes it more maintainable.\nScalability\nAs your application grows, so does the complexity of your database operations. Quality database libraries offer features like connection pooling (i.e. process that maintains a set of open connections to a database, handing them out for repeated use), batch operations, and async support, which are vital for scalability.\nEcosystem Compatibility\nThe ideal database crate should play well with other libraries and frameworks you may be using. For instance, a web framework like Actix has a great set of code examples, for both Diesel and Tokio-Postgres, making your development process smoother.\nCommon Challenges in Database Interaction\nConnection Management\nManaging database connections effectively is a common challenge. Opening too many can stress the database, while too few can lead to underutilization. As developers we need to strike a balance and the crate should assist in this.\nQuery Complexity\nQueries can become increasingly complex. A bad library can make these queries hard to maintain and debug, leading to reduced performance and increased likelihood of errors.\nDatabase Migrations\nManaging schema changes or transitioning from one database system to another can be cumbersome. Some database crates offer built-in support for migrations, easing this process.\nAsynchronous Programming\n(Web) Applications frequently rely on asynchronous I/O operations. While Rust’s async/await syntax is powerful, not all database libraries support it, which can lead to complications in asynchronous applications.\nIn the sections that follow, we will take a closer look at how Diesel, SQLx, and Tokio-Postgres measure up against these challenges and needs, giving you the insights you require to make the best choice for your project.\n\nDiesel: A safe, extensible ORM and Query Builder for Rust\nDiesel is a safe, extensible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and query-building library for Rust. The library takes full advantage of Rust's strong typing and ownership model, making it easier for developers to write robust database applications without worrying about SQL injection vulnerabilities or other common pitfalls. As an ORM, Diesel provides abstractions that allow developers to interact with a database in a more idiomatic Rust manner, rather than raw SQL queries.\nKey Features\n\n\nDSL for Query Generation\n\nDiesel provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for creating SQL queries. This DSL allows you to construct queries in a type-safe, Rust-idiomatic way, reducing errors and increasing code readability. Note that the DSL of Diesel is only relevant when working with Diesel. It must be said that the DSL makes it more convenient to write reusable components. Besides the DSL you can always fallback to Raw SQL. Note that it takes some time to get familiarized with DSL.\n\n\n\nStrong Type System\n\nOne of Diesel's major highlights is its strong type system that ties into Rust's native type system. This adds an additional layer of safety, ensuring that you are less likely to make mistakes when writing queries.\n\n\n\nAsynchronous Support (with diesel-async)\n\nWhile Diesel itself is synchronous, you can integrate it with the async runtime by using third-party extensions like diesel-async.\n\n\n\nCompatibility with Connection Poolers\n\nWhile the library itself doesn't offer built-in connection pooling, it is designed to work seamlessly with third-party connection poolers like bb8 and deadpool. This makes it flexible and adaptable to various use-cases.\n\n\n\n\nData Migration Tools\n\nDiesel's robust type system and built-in migration support make it a good fit for data migration tasks.\n\n\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem\nDiesel enjoys a robust community and is one of the more mature database libraries in the Rust ecosystem. It has a high number of contributors and maintainers (see Diesel overview), and it is widely used in both open-source and commercial projects. The ecosystem around Diesel is rich, with various plugins and extensions to support features like JSON serialization and integration with other popular Rust libraries.\nSQLx: The Rust SQL Toolkit\nSQLx is a modern and versatile SQL client for Rust, offering a unique feature set geared towards maintainability and robustness. One of its standout features is the support for compile-time SQL verification. This means that your SQL queries are checked at compile-time for syntax and even some level of semantic correctness, reducing the runtime errors related to database queries.\nKey Features\n\n\nAsynchronous Support\n\nSQLx is natively designed with asynchronous programming in mind, fully supporting Rust's async/await syntax. This makes it an ideal choice for modern web applications that require non-blocking IO.\n\n\n\nRaw SQL with Compile-time Checks\n\nUnlike many ORMs that try to abstract SQL away, SQLx embraces it. You write raw SQL queries, which are then verified at compile-time for correctness. This combines the power and flexibility of SQL with the safety guarantees of Rust.\n\n\n\nBuilt-in Connection Pooling\n\nConnection management is simplified with SQLx's built-in support for database connection pooling called PgPool, saving you from having to integrate third-party pooling libraries and optimizing database interactions for you.\n\n\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem\nSQLx has rapidly gained traction in the Rust community, thanks to its modern approach to database interaction. Its GitHub repository is active, with contributions from a variety of developers (see SQLx overview). There is also an active community around it, discussing improvements, best practices, and providing help and support. The ecosystem around SQLx is growing.\nTokio-postgres: A native, asynchronous PostgreSQL client.\nTokio-Postgres is a Rust library designed for working directly with PostgreSQL databases in an asynchronous manner. Unlike Diesel and SQLx, which offer various levels of abstraction and ORM capabilities, Tokio-Postgres is oriented towards a more direct, low-level interaction with the database. This makes it a suitable choice for those who require fine-grained control over their SQL queries and database operations.\nKey Features\n\n\nAsynchronous Support\n\nFully integrated with the Tokio runtime, Tokio-Postgres is designed for asynchronous database operations. This enables highly concurrent, non-blocking applications.\n\n\n\nRaw SQL Execution\n\nTokio-Postgres allows for raw SQL query execution, giving developers maximum control over their database interactions.\n\n\n\nCompatibility with Connection Poolers\n\nWhile the library itself doesn't offer built-in connection pooling, it is designed to work seamlessly with third-party connection poolers like bb8 and deadpool. This makes it flexible and adaptable to various use-cases.\n\n\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem\nTokio-Postgres benefits from being a part of the larger Tokio ecosystem, which is widely adopted for asynchronous programming in Rust. The library has a somewhat specialized use-case, but it is well-maintained and has a solid community of users and contributors. Although not as extensive as the ecosystems around Diesel or SQLx, there is community support for extending its functionalities through third-party libraries and poolers.\n\nFeature Matrix Comparison\nFeaturedieselsqlxtokio-postgres\nAsynchronous supportYes with diesel-asyncYesYes\nSynchronous supportYesNoYes (postgres)\nORM (Object Relational Mapping)YesNoNo\nCompile-time SQL verificationYesYesNo\nRaw SQL executionYesYesYes\nConnection poolingVia bb8 or deadpoolBuilt-inVia bb8 or deadpool\nMacros for query generationYesYesNo\nSupports multiple databasesYesYesNo (PostgreSQL specific)\nIntegrated migration toolsYesYesNo\nQuery InterfaceDSL &amp; Raw SQLRaw SQL with MacrosRaw SQL\n\nIn this context:\n\nDSL (Domain Specific Language): diesel offers a Rust-based DSL to construct queries, which allows for more type safety and is more idiomatic to Rust. You can also use raw SQL if desired.\nRaw SQL with Macros: sqlx primarily uses raw SQL but provides macros to enable compile-time verification.\nRaw SQL: tokio-postgres and postgres are more focused on raw SQL without much abstraction.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the above mentions the primary query interfaces for each crate, many of these libraries offer a blend of features, and developers can often choose between raw SQL or more abstracted query generation based on their needs.\nMaking Your Choice\nAfter diving into each of these prominent Rust database crates, the next step is to decide which one aligns most closely with your project’s specific needs. While all three libraries offer a robust set of features, the best choice will depend on a variety of factors, such as performance requirements, type safety, level of control, and the kind of community support you're looking for.\nPerformance\nIf your primary concern is high-performance, non-blocking IO, you might lean towards SQLx or Tokio-Postgres, both of which are designed for asynchronous operations. Diesel, while robust and feature-rich, operates synchronously by default, although there are third-party extensions for async support.\nType Safety\nWhen it comes to type safety, Diesel's strong integration with Rust's type system offers arguably the most robust compile-time checks. SQLx also provides compile-time SQL verification, making it a good choice for projects where type safety is a priority.\nLevel of Control\nIf you need fine-grained control over your SQL queries and prefer to work at a lower level, Tokio-Postgres might be the way to go. Diesel and SQLx provide various levels of abstraction and ORM capabilities, which could be seen as either an advantage or a limitation, depending on your project's needs.\nCommunity Support\nCommunity engagement is another crucial factor. A well-supported library often translates into better documentation, more third-party extensions, and quicker help when you run into issues. Diesel and SQLx have larger communities and more active repositories compared to Tokio-Postgres. However, Tokio-Postgres benefits from being part of the larger Tokio ecosystem, which is itself widely adopted.\nProject Maturity\nFinally, consider the maturity of your selected library. More established projects like Diesel have been battle-tested in a variety of environments, which may give you more confidence in their stability. SQLx, while newer, has rapidly gained maturity and traction. Tokio-Postgres, being more specialized, might not have the same breadth of usage but is stable and reliable for its intended use-cases.\nConclusion\nChoosing a database library is often a trade-off between various factors such as performance, type safety, level of abstraction, and community support. Your project's specific needs will guide your choice, and fortunately, whether you choose Diesel for its powerful ORM capabilities, SQLx for its asynchronous support and type safety, or Tokio-Postgres for low-level control, you're in good hands.\nMy Two Cents\nMy go-to choice has to be SQLx, and for good reason. Not only does it offer native support for asynchronous programming, but it also comes with built-in connection pooling, elevating its efficiency to the next level. Moreover SQLx has compile-time SQL verification, ensuring that your queries are bulletproof before they even hit the runtime. To top it all off, it seamlessly integrates with the Actix Web framework, making it an unparalleled tool in my development arsenal.\nReferences\nDiesel overview\n\nSnapshot Date: September 8, 2023\nGitHub Repository: Diesel GitHub\n\nStars: 10900+\nContributors: 308\n\n\nDocumentation: Diesel Documentation\n\nSQLx overview\n\nSnapshot Date: September 8, 2023\nGitHub Repository: SQLx GitHub\n\nStars: 9700+\nContributors: 322\n\n\nDocumentation: SQLx Documentation\n\nTokio-postgres overview\n\nSnapshot Date: September 8, 2023\nGitHub Repository: Tokio-postgres GitHub\n\nStars: 3000+\nContributors: 120\n\n\nDocumentation: Tokio-postgres Documentation\n\n","id":"https://rust-trends.com/posts/database-crates-diesel-sqlx-tokio-postgress/","title":"Choosing a Rust Database Crate in 2023: Diesel, SQLx, or Tokio-Postgres?"},"https://rust-trends.com/posts/ferrocene-language-specification-donated-to-the-rust-project/":{"body":"Ferrous Systems recently donated the Ferrocene Language Specification (FLS) to the Rust Project, marking a significant milestone toward formalizing the Rust programming language. This article explains the impact and importance of this contribution.\nWhat is the Ferrocene Language Specification?\nThe Ferrocene Language Specification provides a detailed, formal description of Rust’s syntax, semantics, and compiler behavior. Originally developed by Ferrous Systems in 2022 to meet the demands of safety-critical software certification, the FLS precisely documents how Rust behaves, especially the subset supported by Ferrocene, a Rust compiler designed for regulated industries.\nAbout Ferrous Systems and the Rust Foundation\nFerrous Systems has been deeply involved in the Rust ecosystem, providing consulting and tooling tailored for safety-critical industries. Recognizing the importance of a formal specification, Ferrous developed the FLS to support Rust’s adoption in regulated domains.\nThe Rust Foundation, the nonprofit steward of Rust, facilitated this donation, recognizing it as a crucial step toward an official Rust specification. This collaborative effort now positions Rust alongside languages like C and C++, which already have formal standards.\nImplications for Rust’s Future\nWith the integration of the Ferrocene specification, Rust moves closer to having an authoritative standard document. This helps:\n\nStandardization: Rust gains clarity and consistency, making future changes more transparent and predictable. Whereas Rust previously relied on “the compiler is the spec”\nImproved Tooling: Compiler developers, linters, and analysis tools benefit from a formal reference, enabling more robust tooling and ecosystem support.\nSafety-Critical Adoption: Companies working in safety-critical sectors such as automotive or aerospace can now more easily certify Rust-based applications, removing a key barrier to adoption.\n\nKey Takeaways for Developers and the Community\nFor Rust developers, an official specification will serve as a definitive guide, improving clarity, stability, and confidence, especially when writing complex or unsafe code.\nCompanies benefit from a clearer certification path, encouraging broader enterprise and critical infrastructure adoption of Rust.\nThe open-source community gains a single, unified specification, reducing confusion and fostering trust. Ferrous Systems' donation emphasizes the collaborative strength of Rust’s ecosystem.\nIn summary, Ferrous Systems' donation of the Ferrocene specification is a significant leap forward for Rust, solidifying its place as a robust, trustworthy language for both everyday and safety-critical applications.\nIf you want to read more about this on Reddit, a post started by Steve Klabnik, you can find it here.\n","id":"https://rust-trends.com/posts/ferrocene-language-specification-donated-to-the-rust-project/","title":"Ferrocene Language Specification Donated to the Rust Project"},"https://rust-trends.com/posts/mastering-clippy-elevating-your-rust-code-quality/":{"body":"Clippy is an essential linter for Rust, helping to catch common mistakes and improve code quality by providing insightful warnings and suggestions.

Rust macros provide a way to avoid repetitive code, allowing you to define reusable code templates. Unlike functions, macros don't operate on values; instead, they operate on the code itself.\nMacros in Rust work like meta-programming. They are a way to define reusable chunks of code that get \"expanded\" or \"transformed\" into more detailed code at compile time. This is like giving the compiler a recipe to generate specific chunks of code on the fly.\nFor instance, you might have used the println!() macro. The ! indicates it's a macro. With macros, you can achieve functionalities that functions can't offer, like variadic arguments or pattern-based code generation. Another example of a macros are expressions like #[tokio::main], called an attribute macro.\nWhy Use cargo expand?\nWhen working with macros, you might wonder what the actual code generated by these macros looks like. This is where cargo expand comes in handy. It allows you to see the result of all the macro expansions, giving you a peek into the detailed, often boilerplate-heavy, code that gets generated.\nUsing cargo expand with Your Code\nConsider the simple Actix Web server code provided below:\n\nHere, the #[tokio::main] is an attribute macro provided by the Tokio crate. Tokio is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It provides the building blocks needed for writing network applications. The attribute macro sets up the necessary boilerplate to run asynchronous code in the main function. But what does this boilerplate look like?\nTo find out, you'd first need to install cargo expand:\n\nThen, in the root of your Rust project, run:\n\nThe output will be the code after all macros, including #[tokio::main], have been expanded. This \"expanded\" version will show you the underlying boilerplate introduced by the macro, revealing all the magic that happens behind the scenes.\n\nLet's break down the transformation that has occurred due to the #[tokio::main] macro:\n\nAsync Block: The entire async part of the original main function has been encapsulated inside an async block, and this block is assigned to the body variable:\n\n\nThis body variable holds the asynchronous logic, but by itself, it doesn't execute anything. It merely describes the asynchronous computation.\n\nTokio Runtime Setup: For the asynchronous code to be executed, a runtime is required. This runtime manages the low-level details of task scheduling, IO, etc. The expanded code sets up this runtime explicitly:\n\n\nHere, a multi-threaded Tokio runtime is being built with all features enabled.\n\nBlocking on Async: The following line:\n\n\nTells the runtime to execute the async block (body) and block the current thread until this asynchronous computation has finished.\n\nClippy Allowance: The line #[allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::diverging_sub_expression)] is a hint to the Clippy linting tool to ignore certain potential warnings about the subsequent code. This is added to ensure the generated code doesn't trigger linting warnings.\n\nSummary:\nIn essence, the #[tokio::main] macro abstracts away the complexities of setting up the Tokio runtime and managing the transition between synchronous and asynchronous code. By using this macro, developers can focus on the core asynchronous logic without getting bogged down by boilerplate. The expanded version reveals all the \"magic\" that happens behind the scenes to make the async main function work seamlessly.\nIn essence, cargo expand offers an invaluable tool for anyone diving deep into Rust's powerful macro system, helping developers demystify and understand the inner workings of their code. You can try it your self on #[derive()] Traits. By adding #[derive(Debug)] to one of your custom structs or enums. Use cargo expand to see what code is generated, and then use the println!(\"{:?}\", instance_of_your_struct); to print the debug representation. Similarly, explore with #[derive(PartialEq)] and test it by comparing two instances of your struct with == and !=. Happy coding!\n","id":"https://rust-trends.com/posts/rust-macros-revealed/","title":"Rust Macros Revealed!"},"https://rust-trends.com/posts/rust-s-async-closures/":{"body":"Rust’s upcoming async closures are an exciting feature set to land in Rust 1.85. If you’ve ever tried to write a closure inside an async function, you’ve likely hit a wall. Until now, closures couldn’t be async themselves, forcing developers to work around the limitation with named async functions. But with async closures, Rustaceans will finally get the closure they’ve been seeking!\nWhat Are Closures in Rust?\nClosures in Rust are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their surrounding scope. They’re often used for short, throwaway functions, making code more concise and expressive. Closures in Rust can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and even return values.\nExample of a Basic Closure:\n\nHere, add_one is a closure that takes an i32 increments it with 1 and returns the resulting i32.\nClosures Capturing Variables:\n\nThis closure captures multiplier from its environment.\nWhy Do We Need Async Closures?\nPreviously, if you wanted to write an async function inside another function, you had to define it separately:\n\nThis is clunky! Async closures will allow a more natural syntax.\nExample: Using an Async Closure\n\nNow fetcher is a true async closure that can be used inside async contexts seamlessly.\nExample: Using an Async Closure in Tokio\n\nHere, we define an async closure that waits for two seconds before printing a message. Want to try it out? Here is a Rust playground link to the code snippet. Note that for now Beta Rust is required to run async closures.\nWhat’s Next?\nWith Rust 1.85, async closures will make writing asynchronous code more ergonomic. They’ll be useful in scenarios like async iterators, event handling, and networking.\nSo, Rustaceans, are you ready to embrace async closures? They’re coming soon—probably faster than your coffee cools down!\n","id":"https://rust-trends.com/posts/rust-s-async-closures/","title":"Rust’s Async Closures: A New Way to Handle Asynchronous Logic"},"https://rust-trends.com/posts/rust-s-if-let-while-chains/":{"body":"One of the long-awaited features in Rust is if/let while chains, and it’s finally on the way! This small but powerful change will make conditional expressions and loops more ergonomic, eliminating some of the verbosity that Rustaceans have had to deal with.\nWhat’s the Problem?\nCurrently, if you want to combine multiple conditions involving if let and while let, you have to nest them or write separate conditions, making the code harder to read.\nFor example, if you wanted to check whether an Option contains a value and another condition holds, you’d have to write:\n\nOr in a while loop with a game of blackjack:\n\nThis indentation gets annoying fast!\nWhat’s Changing?\nWith if/let while chains, Rust will let you write conditions in a more natural way. Instead of nesting if let inside an if, you can chain them together like this:\n\nSimilarly, for while let:\n\n⚠ Note: These examples will only work once if/let while chains are stabilized! You can run it on the Rust Playground if you select Rust version: Nightly.\nThis makes the intent much clearer and eliminates unnecessary nesting. Just what we need!\nWhy Is This Useful?\n\nCleaner Code – No more deep nesting just to check additional conditions.\nBetter Readability – The logic is clearer at a glance.\nImproved Consistency – Other languages allow similar patterns, and Rust is catching up.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nRust has always emphasized safety and clarity, but small ergonomic tweaks like if/let while chains help make code easier to write and read.\nWith this feature expected to land soon, you’ll be able to streamline your control flow—no hacks, no unnecessary nesting, just clean Rust.\nNow, if only debugging borrow checker errors could be this easy… 😆\n\nP.S. Previously, I had a while let chain example that was incorrect and didn’t function the same way as the code without this feature. Thanks to Günter’s keen eye, he pointed out the mistake—much appreciated!\n","id":"https://rust-trends.com/posts/rust-s-if-let-while-chains/","title":"Rust’s if/let While Chains: Cleaner Control Flow is Coming!"},"https://rust-trends.com/posts/unpacking-rust-s-match-operator-with-community-insights/":{"body":"Introduction\nIn the dynamic world of software development, sharing and discussing code snippets on platforms like LinkedIn can provide immense value, both through receiving insightful feedback and fostering community engagement. This post is inspired by an (overly) simplified Rust example using the match operator — a powerful tool in Rust's arsenal. Below, I'll break down the code snippet I posted, explore the constructive feedback received, and discuss general tips for writing better Rust code shared by our community.\nThe Original Code Snippet\nHere's a brief code snippet to illustrate the usage of the match operator in Rust:\n\nPlayground link\nUse of match for Control Flow: The match operator is akin to a switch statement but more powerful. It allows a value to be compared against a series of patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches. This is particularly useful for enums in Rust, as demonstrated in our TrafficLight example.\nElevate Your Rust Skills with CodeCrafters! 🚀 [advertisement]\nJoin us in partnership with CodeCrafters to build your own HTTP server for FREE!

Thank you for your support! 🙏\nLet's continue with the article!\nCommunity Insights\nThe LinkedIn post generated a lot of engagement, with several community members sharing their thoughts and suggestions. Here are some key insights:\nEliminate Mutable Declaration\nOne community member suggested eliminating the need for a mutable declaration for light by only assigning it once. This can be achieved by using a loop to iterate over the values of the enumeration and printing directly within the iteration without reassigning light.\nMy interpretation of this suggestion is as follows:\n\nPlayground link\nExplanation of Key Parts:\n\nFunction Signature: The action function now accepts a reference to a TrafficLight (&amp;TrafficLight) instead of owning it. This is a more flexible approach, especially when you don't need to take ownership of the value.\nMatching Inside action: Inside the action function, the match statement now needs to dereference the light argument to access the enum values (*light).\n\nImplement Display Trait\nAnother community member suggested implementing the Display trait for the TrafficLight enum to allow for more readable output.\nThis can be achieved by adding the following code:\n\nPlayground link\nDocumentation std::fmt\nExplanation of Key Parts:\n\nUse Statement: The use std::fmt; is necessary to bring the fmt module into scope, which contains the Display trait and Formatter struct needed for implementing custom display behavior.\nImplementing Display: The impl fmt::Display for TrafficLight block defines how to convert each variant of the TrafficLight enum to a String. The method fmt takes a mutable reference to a Formatter object and returns a Result that indicates whether the operation was successful or not.\nMatch Statement: Inside the fmt method, a match expression determines what string corresponds to each enum variant.\nwrite! Macro: This macro is used to write the formatted string into the provided buffer (f), which is part of the functionality provided by the Formatter.\n\nUse the crates strum and strum_macros\nYes, you probably thought it already — if you are doing something like this in Rust, there's a crate for that! Turns out strum is here, and a helpful community member pointed out that it can be used to simplify the code. strum and its companion strum_macros bring additional functionalities that make working with enums much more flexible and expressive.\nHere is how you can use it, my interpretation of the suggestion:\n\nDocumentation strum\nThis code snippet leverages strum to automatically implement the Display trait for the TrafficLight enum, customizing the output string for each variant using the serialize attribute. Moreover, EnumIter is used to create an iterator over the enum, which simplifies looping through its values. This combination not only reduces boilerplate but also enhances the readability and maintainability of your code. Thanks to strum, managing enums in Rust becomes a breeze, focusing more on what you want your code to do rather than how to set up basic functionalities.\nEncapsulate Behavior within the Enum\nA suggestion from another community member highlighted a more integrated approach: they prefer to encapsulate the behavior directly within the enum. Additionally, they recommended making the action function constant (const).\nHere’s an implementation based on that suggestion:\n\nNote in this example I am still using strum to iterate over the enum variants, because it makes the code more concise and readable.\nHow to generate such great code snippets?\n\nOne community member asked how to generate such great code snippets images I use ray.so for generating code snippets. It's a fantastic tool for creating beautiful code images for sharing on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. You can check it out here.\nConclusion\nSharing code snippets and engaging with the community can lead to valuable insights and improvements in your coding practices. By exploring the feedback and suggestions provided by the community, you can enhance your understanding of Rust and learn new ways to write more efficient and readable code. Remember, the Rust community is always ready to help and share knowledge, so don't hesitate to participate and contribute to the vibrant ecosystem of Rust developers.\nWhile the match operator was the main focus, the ensuing discussions and improvements turned out to be even more intriguing and significant.\nHappy coding! 🦀\nP.s. if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to drop me a message.
