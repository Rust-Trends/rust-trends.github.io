Happy New Year Rustaceans! 2023 is the year of more Rust Trends. No boring summary of the year, but instead content specifically selected for you. Let me know what you think of the newsletters and subjects you want to hear more about. Let’s dive in …

__In today’s email:__

- __Rust + WebAssembly = Web + Speed__
- __Comprehensive Rust, want to learn Rust?__
- __Note-taking app the Rust alternative for Notion__

## Rust + WebAssembly = Web + Speed
<div class="row"><div class="column">WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary format for running code in web browsers that has gained a lot of traction in the last few years. It allows developers to run code written in languages other than JavaScript, such as C++ or Rust, in the browser, enabling the creation of more complex and performant web applications.

Rust has a number of features that make it especially suited for compiling to Wasm, including a focus on performance and safety, a strong type system, and low-level control over memory. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MraEYwI9C5o&t=163s&ab_channel=Let%27sGetRusty" target="_blank">2 minutes Youtube intro</a> by Let’s Get Rusty.

Using Rust and WebAssembly together allows developers to take advantage of Rust’s strengths while still being able to run their code in the browser. This can be useful for applications that need to perform computationally intensive tasks, such as image or video processing, scientific simulations, or data visualization. A real-world example is the all-in-one design program <a href="https://www.websitebuilderinsider.com/how-figma-uses-wasm/" target="_blank">Figma</a>. Note that <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/" target="_blank">Figma uses C++</a> but could also have been Rust.

Overall, Rust and WebAssembly offer a lot of potential for building high-performance and reliable web applications. As more developers start using this combination, we can expect to see even more exciting and innovative applications built with Rust and <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">Wasm</a>.

## Comprehensive Rust, want to learn Rust?
<div class="row"><div class="column"><a href="https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/" target="_blank"><img src="../8/android.webp" alt="Android" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border:0"></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/" target="_blank">Comprehensive Rust</a> is a 4-day course developed by the Google Android team. Only the fourth day is Android specific, for the rest a nice generic course to follow for starters.

This course comes with a <a href="https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>

In a previous newsletter, we also highlighted that Android was using Rust and that they saw a steep <a href="https://rust-trends.com/the-rust-enthusiasm-is-spreading/" target="_blank">decline in vulnerabilities</a>.</div></div>



## Note-taking app the Rust alternative for Notion
<div class="row"><div class="column"><a href="https://appflowy.io/" target="_blank">AppFlowy.io</a> calls itself the open-source alternative to Notion. They started in November 2021 and have got a lot of traction from the beginning.

It is written in Rust and <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a> and has been one of the trending <a href="https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy" target="_blank">GitHub repositories</a>.

If you are looking for a free and good note-taking app, for sure give it a try.</div>
