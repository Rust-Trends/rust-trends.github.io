description = "This edition of the Rust trends newsletter is centered around setting up your own Rust project, whether it be an app with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or a Command Line Interface (CLI). Discover how to use Rust's package manager `cargo' for project setup and understand Rust's module system. Explore how you can create your own GUI app with 'Tauri', a popular toolkit, and how to harness the power of Rust for CLI using the 'Clap' crate."

The Rust community is active and has tons of nice articles, tutorials, applications, and repositories but we have to choose. This fifth email is all about setting up your project for a GUI app or CLI utility. Let’s dive in …

__In today’s email:__

- __Setting up your own Rust project__
- __Want to make your own app with a GUI?__
- __Command Line Interface:__ unleash the power of Rust

# Setting up your own Rust project
<div class="row"><div class="column">When starting a new Rust project, the package manager <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/" target="_blank">cargo</a> for Rust has you covered. With a simple command in your terminal <code>cargo new project_name</code> you are ready to write your Rust application.

But what if you want to add additional files or directories to your project? Rust uses a module system, with modules and submodules. Then questions arise on how to include those modules. Do I know where to put my unit tests and integration tests? That’s why I created a dummy project to show the possibilities, please check it out on <a href="https://github.com/Rust-Trends/example_project_structure" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

Other nice reads are a blog article on Hackernoon, and for testing, you can also have a look at the documentation of Rust by Example <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/testing.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

The great thing about Rust is that testing, benchmarking, examples, and package management are not an afterthought but rather integrated from the start.

# Want to make your own app with a GUI?
<div class="row"><div class="column"><a href="https://tauri.app/about/intro" target="_blank"><img src="../5/ferris-app.webp" alt="Tauri for GUI apps" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border:0"></a></div><div class="column">The ecosystem of Rust is ever-growing. One popular toolkit is <a href="https://tauri.app/about/intro" target="_blank">Tauri</a>. With this toolkit, you can build <a href="https://awesomeapp.org/" target="_blank">Awesome</a> graphical applications for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

The GUI/frontend is based on web technology like javascript/typescript and HTML.

Tauri is really worth looking at if you want to develop a (simple) desktop application.</div></div>


# Command Line Interface: unleash the power of Rust
<div class="row"><div class="column">Command line programs are popular among Rust developers. It is an easy starting point if you want to make something in Rust.

There is a free getting-started book called <a href="https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html" target="_blank">Command Line Applications in Rust</a>.

The <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/" target="_blank">Clap</a> crate is an easy-to-use command line parser and a great fit for your next CLI project.

For more inspiration have a look at existing CLI utilities on <a href="https://lib.rs/command-line-utilities" target="_blank">lib.rs</a>.</div>
