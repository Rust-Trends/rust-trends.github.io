This edition of Rust Trends has it all: insights into Rust’s role in embedded systems, Microsoft’s large-scale rewrites, and a DIY WiFi-controlled car project powered by Rust and ESP32 and more.

But that’s not all—we’re also hosting a special Rust giveaway for the upcoming end of the year holiday season! Curious? Read on to find out how you can snag some Rusty goodies.

Let’s dive in! 🎉

# Dive into SQLite Internals with Rust

Ever wondered how SQLite works under the hood? Geoffrey Copin’s tutorials take you step-by-step through building your own SQLite clone using Rust—perfect for systems programming enthusiasts and the database-curious alike.

## Part 1: Listing Tables

Learn to parse SQLite database files and implement the .tables command in <a href="https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-1-listing-tables" target="_blank">“Build your own SQLite, Part 1: Listing Tables”</a>.

## Part 2: Scanning Large Tables

Handle tables spanning multiple pages, explore B-tree interior pages, and refine scanning logic in <a href="https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-2-scanning-large-tables" target="_blank">“Build your own SQLite, Part 2: Scanning Large Tables”</a>.

## Part 3: SQL Parsing 101

Dive into interpreting SQL queries and translating them into database actions with <a href="“Build your own SQLite, Part 3: SQL Parsing 101”" target="_blank">“Build your own SQLite, Part 3: SQL Parsing 101”</a>.

## Part 4: Coming Soon!

The series isn’t stopping here—Part 4 is in the works! Expect even more depth as Geoffrey continues to break down SQLite’s magic in Rust.

Follow along and take your Rust skills to the next level!

# At EuroRust 2024: Embedded Systems and Big Tech Journeys

EuroRust 2024 brought some phenomenal talks, and here are two must-watch highlights that capture the breadth of Rust’s potential—from embedded systems to major rewrites in Big Tech:

**Jonathan Pallant: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ewuFNKIAVI&t=133s" target="_blank">“SD Cards, Filesystems, and Embedded Rust”</a>** JP takes us on a journey into embedded development, showing how embedded-hal makes it possible to write portable SD Card drivers across microcontrollers. With Rust’s types ensuring safer command handling and responses, this talk is a treasure trove for anyone navigating low-level development. Bonus: the dive into Microsoft’s FAT filesystem will give you fresh insights into how files and directories are represented on disk.

**Victor Ciura: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiG5-LzIQ54" target="_blank">“Let’s Rewrite It in Rust”</a>** Once just a meme, rewriting in Rust is now a serious business—especially at Microsoft. Victor shares stories from Microsoft365’s Oxidizer effort, where Rust foundational libraries are transforming the organization. His perspective on coming to Rust from both C++ and C# backgrounds highlights the gems, gaps, and tools you should know about if you’re considering a similar leap.

These talks underscore how versatile Rust has become, tackling challenges from embedded systems to enterprise-scale libraries. Whether you’re looking to optimize hardware interactions or rewrite legacy systems, there’s inspiration here for everyone.

Have a favorite insight or challenge you’d like to share? Let’s keep the conversation going!

# Build a WiFi-Controlled Car with Rust and ESP32

Ever wanted to mix Rust with robotics? James McMurray’s WiFi-controlled car project shows how you can create a rover with an ESP32 board and Rust. Here’s the scoop:

## The Setup:

The car uses an ESP32 board for control, an ESP32-CAM for live video, and motor drivers to handle movement. WiFi lets you send commands from a Rust-based client on your PC while viewing real-time video.

## What Makes It Cool:

Rust’s safety and performance powers both the car and the control app.

esp-wifi and embedded-hal crates simplify hardware and networking.

Challenges like WiFi issues and camera setup are well-documented, making it beginner-friendly.

## Future Potential:

Add features like obstacle detection, better motor control, or BLE for WiFi setup.

<a href="https://jamesmcm.github.io/blog/esp32-wifi-tank/" target="_blank">Check out the full guide and code here</a>. Whether you’re new to Rust or love embedded systems, this project is a fun way to dive in.
