# Grok: A Rust-Powered Leap in AI

Grok emerges as a witty AI assistant on X, formerly known as Twitter, but what truly sets it apart is its Rust-based infrastructure. Developed by <a href="https://x.ai/" target="_blank">xAI</a>, Grok leverages Rust's robustness to build a reliable and efficient system that underpins its AI operations.

## Rust's Role in Grok's Development
The engineering team at xAI chose Rust for its performance and safety guarantees, which are essential for the distributed systems running Grok. Rust's compile-time error checking ensures that Grok's infrastructure is less prone to bugs and system failures, a critical feature when synchronizing computations across thousands of GPUs.

## Efficiency and Reliability
Rust's efficiency is not just about speed; it's about maximizing compute per watt, a key focus for xAI. This efficiency has enabled Grok to rapidly improve, as evidenced by its strong performance on machine learning benchmarks, even with limited training resources compared to larger models.

## The Future with Rust
As xAI prepares for the next phase of Grok's capabilities, Rust's role becomes even more pivotal. It's not just about maintaining the current system; it's about scaling up and integrating new features seamlessly. Rust's promise of reliability and maintainability makes it an ideal choice for Grok's journey ahead.

In the AI landscape, Grok is a shining example of how Rust's strengths can be harnessed to build the next generation of intelligent systems.


# Memory safety for the Internet's most critical infrastructure
<img src="../29/Prossimo.webp" alt="Prossimo an initiative focused on memory safety for critical internet infrastructure" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; border:0">

Prossimo, an initiative focused on memory safety for critical internet infrastructure, advocates for the use of Rust to enhance security and reliability. Key initiatives include replacing OpenSSL with the <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/rustls/" target="_blank">Rustls</a> TLS library, creating memory-safe drivers for the Linux kernel, and developing a memory-safe <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/av1/" target="_blank">AV1 decoder</a>. The organization also targets utility tools like sudo and su for safer privilege mediation, and aims to create memory-safe implementations for <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/ntp/" target="_blank">NTP</a> and <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/dns/" target="_blank">DNS</a>. <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/" target="_blank">Prossimo</a> encourages community involvement through donations and advocacy for memory-safe code in the workplace, with a straightforward framework for funding and commencing initiatives.

Among the funders of the initiatives are names like, Sovereign-Tech-Fund, Cisco, Google, Fly.io, AWS, OpenSSF and FutureWei Technologies.

Nice to see such fruitful initiatives that introduces memory safety to every day software.
