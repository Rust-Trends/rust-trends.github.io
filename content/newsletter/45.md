# Podcast Highlight: Rust used in Drone technology
<img src="../45/Drone-Wind-turbines.webp" alt="Drones and Rust" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%; border:0">

In the latest episode of the ‚ÄúRust in Production‚Äù podcast, <a href="https://corrode.dev/podcast/s02e06-fusion-engineering/" target="_blank">Jakub Valtar from Fusion Engineering</a> shares his insights on using Rust to develop next-generation flight controllers for drones. This episode is a must-listen for anyone interested in drone technology and Rust‚Äôs application in performance-critical environments. As I am building my own flight controller, Jakub‚Äôs discussion on their use of Rust, specific crates, hardware, and design patterns was particularly enlightening.

## Why Fusion Engineering Chose Rust
Fusion Engineering transitioned from C++ to Rust to take advantage of its memory safety, type system, and concurrency features. Jakub highlighted how Rust‚Äôs focus on performance, reliability, and productivity aligns perfectly with the needs of flight controllers. Rust helps prevent many common bugs and ensures that critical software operates smoothly without unexpected crashes.

## Key Crates Used by Fusion Engineering

- <a href="https://crates.io/crates/inline-python" target="_blank">inline-python</a>: Embeds Python code directly in Rust, useful for simulations and plotting outputs.
- <a href="https://crates.io/crates/intbits" target="_blank">intbits</a>: Works with individual bits, crucial for hardware drivers.
- <a href="https://crates.io/crates/git-version" target="_blank">git-version</a>: Embeds Git version information in binaries, ensuring version consistency across software components.
- <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow" target="_blank">anyhow</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror" target="_blank">thiserror</a>: Streamline error handling.
- <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra" target="_blank">nalgebra</a>: Handles complex mathematical computations needed for flight control algorithms.
- <a href="https://crates.io/crates/arrayvec" target="_blank">arrayvec</a>: Manages fixed-size arrays to avoid dynamic allocations, crucial for predictable performance.

## Hardware and Software Patterns
Fusion Engineering‚Äôs hardware setup includes a custom PCB with sensors and an STM32 microcontroller, along with a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 running a Linux-based system. They employ several design patterns to ensure robust and maintainable code:

- <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/newtype.html" target="_blank">Newtype Pattern</a>: Encapsulates primitive types to add semantic meaning and avoid errors.
- Enum States: Manages different modes and states of the drone, ensuring clear and maintainable state transitions.
- Service-Oriented Architecture: Runs different processes as separate services, each responsible for specific tasks, communicating through shared memory e.g. files.

## Benefits of Using Rust
Rust‚Äôs ecosystem, including its package manager, testing framework, and excellent documentation, has enabled Fusion Engineering to maintain high-quality code. The strong type system and memory safety guarantees have made Rust an ideal choice for their multidisciplinary team, allowing both software engineers and control engineers to contribute effectively, this would not have been possible with C/C++.

## About Mara Bos
Fusion Engineering was co-founded by Mara Bos, a prominent figure in the Rust community and a member of the Rust team. Mara is well-known for her contributions to Rust‚Äôs development and for authoring the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Atomics-Locks-Low-Level-Concurrency/dp/1098119444" target="_blank">Rust Atomics and Locks</a>, which delves into concurrency in Rust. Her leadership and expertise have been instrumental in driving Fusion Engineering‚Äôs innovative use of Rust for drone technology.
