### Why Rust in Production?
Matthias Endler's article, "<a href="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/" target="_blank">Why Rust in Production?</a>" on Corrode, is a comprehensive and insightful exploration of the increasing interest in Rust, especially among tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The article addresses a common gap in the dialogue about Rust: the skewed understanding of its application in production settings, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.

Matthias, through his role as a Rust consultant, brings a wealth of experience from working with various companies. He emphasizes that businesses often prioritize productivity, stability, and long-term maintainability over mere performance. His insights are backed by public data and surveys, adding credibility to his observations.

The article delves into the reasons for using Rust in production, highlighting its reliability, stability, predictable runtime behavior, cost savings, and developer ergonomics. It also touches upon the focus on long-term sustainability and the increasing popularity of Rust among developers.

However, he doesn't shy away from discussing the challenges associated with Rust, such as its immature ecosystem, the scarcity of experienced developers, and the steep learning curve. He provides a balanced view, acknowledging the commitment required to integrate Rust into a technology stack.

For anyone considering Rust for their projects or simply curious about its growing popularity, Matthias Endler's article is an essential read.

<img src="../30/crab-certification.webp" alt="Training and Certification Program" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; border:0">

The Rust Foundation has announced its plan to develop a <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/the-rust-foundation-to-develop-training-and-certification-program/" target="_blank">training and certification program</a> for the Rust programming language. This initiative reflects the language's growing popularity, as evidenced by its repeated recognition as the most-loved programming language and the increasing demand for Rust courses. The Foundation aims to use the proceeds from this program to support the Rust community and ecosystem.

This program is in its early planning stages and involves collaboration with Rust community experts, including Tim McNamara, an experienced Rust educator. The Foundation's goal is to supplement existing Rust education resources, empower educators, and provide a means for professionals to verify their Rust skills. Details on course pricing and structure are still being developed, with a focus on directing all proceeds towards supporting Rust Foundation initiatives and the Rust Project.
