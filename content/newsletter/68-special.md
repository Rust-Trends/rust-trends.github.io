While you're soaking up the sun or taking a well-earned summer break, why not squeeze in some Rust? We are launching the **Rust-Trends Contest** on CodeCrafters from **July 1 to August 1** ‚Äî the perfect way to make your summer both relaxing and productive.

## What is the Rust-Trends Summer Contest?

This is a Rust programming contest run with CodeCrafters, where you‚Äôll solve hands-on coding challenges, like **building your own shell**,  and earn points as you go.

It‚Äôs all about real-world Rust, community spirit, and a touch of summer competition.

Join here: <a href="https://app.codecrafters.io/join_team?invite_code=a207679ba061d1e4" target="_blank">Rust-Trends Team on CodeCrafters</a>

## How It Works

- Complete coding stages to earn points:
  - Very Easy: 5 pts
  - Easy: 15 pts
  - Medium: 30 pts
  - Hard: 50 pts
- Points count only once per unique stage (per person, not per language).
- Score resets after the contest ends on August 1.
- Top 15 show up on the leaderboard.

## Prizes for the Top Rustacean

The highest scorer on August 1 gets to choose one of:

- **Keychron Q1 Pro** (for the keyboard connoisseurs)
- **Oura Ring 4 Black** (wellness meets developer life)
- **Apple AirPods Pro 2** (code in noise-cancelling peace)

You‚Äôll need a <a href="https://app.codecrafters.io/join?via=Rust-Trends" target="_blank">**CodeCrafters subscription - 40% OFF**</a> to be eligible for prizes, but participation is open to everyone. Just want to build and learn Rust this summer? That‚Äôs totally fine too, e.g. the build your own shell challenge is completely free this month.

## Make This Summer Count

- Build real, portfolio-worthy Rust projects
- Learn at your own pace, whether you're at the beach or your desk
- Subscription might be reimbursable by your employer
- You‚Äôll also be supporting Rust-Trends if you go premium, use this <a href="https://app.codecrafters.io/join?via=Rust-Trends" target="_blank">referral link to get 40% off</a> ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Play It Straight

CodeCrafters has strong anti-cheat protections in place. Any funny business leads to a **1-year ban**. Let‚Äôs keep it cool and code clean.

I'll be following the <a href="https://app.codecrafters.io/contests/rust-trends-1" target="_blank">leaderboard</a> and sharing community highlights during July. It‚Äôs a chill but competitive way to sharpen your skills this summer.

Ready to Rust your way through the holidays?

Catch you on the leaderboard ü¶Ä

Cheers,
