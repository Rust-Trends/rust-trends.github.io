<p><q>Running Rust on AWS Lambda, improve your coding style and a blazing fast CLI search tool written in Rust</q></p>

The third newsletter with your dose of Rust Trends. Feel free to reply to this email if you have ideas to share… Let’s dive into the content.

__In today’s email:__

- __Lambdas and Rust:__ running your Rust code in Amazon’s AWS
- __Rust Style Team:__ improve your coding style
- __Alternative to grep:__ a command line search tool on steroids

## Lambdas and Rust
<div class="row"><div class="column">Want to run your code faster and more energy efficient? Lambdas are one of the workhorses of Amazon’s AWS. Lambdas are programmatic functions that you pay by running time they are rounded to the nearest millisecond. So time is money?! To optimize for cost there are two important takeaways ARM & Rust. Arm CPUs are energy efficient and Rust is fast, both are factors that influence the cost. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/sustainability-with-rust/">AWS post</a> on Rust, another <a href="https://filia-aleks.medium.com/aws-lambda-battle-x86-vs-arm-graviton2-perfromance-3581aaef75d9" target="_blank">blog post on x86 vs Arm</a> Graviton, and a more practical <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-using-aws-lambda-with-rust-saved-3x-the-cost-compared-to-using-python-or-net" target="_blank">Hackernoon</a> article. </div><div class="column"><img src="../3/rust-lambdas.webp" alt="Rust Lambdas and ARM" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border:0"></div></div>



## Improve your coding style
<div class="row"><div class="column"><img src="../3/hello-world.webp" alt="Hello World" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border:0"></div><div class="column">The Rust language gains in popularity and regularly gets new language constructs. Reasons for the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/09/29/announcing-the-rust-style-team.html">Rust Style Team</a> to actively maintain a standard style guide. This style is integrated into the widely used <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt</a> tool, often used by the IDEs, that automatically formats your code. The standardized style guide helps to keep code readable and uniform across projects and the Rust ecosystem. See also this <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/rust-programming-language-outlines-plan-for-updates-to-style-guide/" target="_blank">ZDNet article</a>.</div></div>


## Speedup search results
<div class="row"><div class="column">Many people know the command line CLI command grep. But did you know a faster grep tool is available and written in Rust? It is called ripgrep and is abbreviated as <code>rg</code>. The link to the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep" target="_blank">official ripgrep repo</a>. The command is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. A benchmark between ripgrep, grep and other tools can be found <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/" target="_blank">here</a>. Want to learn about the internals then this <a href="https://blog.mbrt.dev/posts/ripgrep/" target="_blank">Code review</a> is something for you. </div><div class="column"><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep" target="_blank"><img src="../3/ripgrep.webp" alt="Ripgrep" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border:0"></a></div></div>
