# Algorithms written in Rust
<img src="../9/algorithms.webp" alt="Algorithms" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%; border:0">
Algorithms are a crucial part of computer science, and they play a vital role in many areas of software development. From sorting data to searching for information, algorithms help us solve problems and perform tasks efficiently.

If you are a Rust programmer looking to learn more about algorithms, a great resource to check out is <a href="https://the-algorithms.com/language/rust" target="_blank">this website</a>. The website is accompanied by this <a href="https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust" target="_blank">repository</a> that showcases the collection of algorithms written in Rust.

The “TheAlgorithms/Rust” repository contains a wide range of algorithms, including those for sorting, searching, and ciphers. It also includes implementations of various data structures, such as lists, trees, and graphs. The repository is maintained by contributors who are committed to keeping it up-to-date and relevant for Rust programmers.

If you are interested in learning more about algorithms and how they can be implemented in Rust, be sure to check it out. The nice thing about the website is that it uses the <a href="https://github.com/integer32llc/rust-playground" target="_blank">online playground</a> platform, so you do not need to have Rust installed to try it out.

# Will this be your next Operating System in Rust?
<div class="row"><div class="column"><img src="../9/Raspberry-pi.webp" alt="Raspberry Pi and Rust programming" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border:0"></div><div class="column">Rust is a language that is gaining popularity in Operating System (OS) development and the Raspberry Pi is a low-cost and powerful platform that can be used to learn and experiment with building an OS.

There are several <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials" target="_blank">tutorials</a> and resources available for learning how to develop an OS in Rust on the Raspberry Pi, including creating a custom kernel, developing drivers, and creating a minimal operating system. There are also projects like <a href="https://www.tockos.org/" target="_blank">TockOS</a>, which uses Rust to create a secure and efficient embedded operating system.

The Rust programming language provides a powerful and safe alternative for building an OS on the Raspberry Pi. The growing community and resources available make it an attractive choice for those interested in this field.</div></div>


# Networking with Rust crates
Rust is a system programming language, that provides a safe and efficient way to build networked systems. One of the key features of Rust for network programming is its low-level control over memory, which allows for building high-performance and efficient networked systems. Additionally, Rust provides built-in support for low-level network programming, such as socket programming, which enables developers to handle network protocols such as TCP, UDP, and other transport protocols.

To get started with network programming in Rust, you can use the standard library‘s support for low-level network programming, such as the `std::net module`, or use specialized libraries such as __mio__ and __tokio__ which provide more high-level abstractions and are built on top of the standard library.

Here are a few resources that you may find helpful when getting started with network programming in Rust:

The Rust documentation on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/" target="_blank">Network Programming</a>
The <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio project</a> and the starter <a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial" target="_blank">tutorial</a>
<a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio" target="_blank">Mio</a>: minimalistic, efficient async I/O library for Rust.
