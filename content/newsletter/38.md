## Introduction to Oxide Computer Company

Oxide Computer Company, renowned for its pioneering approach in cloud computing, aims to revolutionize the centralized model of cloud services. Their product, a commercial cloud computer, is designed to bring hyperscale cloud computing benefits to individual companies on-premises, marking a shift in the cloud computing landscape with their own hardware and software solutions powered by Rust.

## Innovative Rack-Scale System Development

A standout aspect of Oxide Computer Company's approach is their comprehensive development of a rack-scale system from **scratch**. This endeavor demonstrates their deep commitment to redefining cloud computing infrastructure **with the support of Rust**.

**Vertical Integration:** Oxide's development of a rack-scale system epitomizes vertical integration. Unlike many cloud computing providers who assemble pre-made components, Oxide designs and builds each aspect of their hardware and **software**. This approach allows for unparalleled optimization and customization to meet specific performance and security needs.

**Rack-Scale System Design:** The Oxide rack-scale system is a unification of hardware and software, tailor-made for delivering cloud computing in on-premises data centers. This design offers businesses the benefits of cloud performance with the control and security of on-premises infrastructure. By engineering both the hardware and the Rust software components, Oxide ensures seamless integration and maximized efficiency.

This development aligns with the emerging trend of companies rethinking their cloud strategies, increasingly bringing cloud infrastructure in-house (on-premise). This shift represents a move away from complete reliance on traditional cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as businesses seek greater control, security, and (cost) efficiency in their cloud operations.

## Features of the System:

- **High-Performance Computing:** Oxide's system is purpose-built for high-performance computing, networking, and storage. Where Rust fits in seamlessly, ensuring the system's reliability and performance.
- **Energy Efficiency:** A key feature is the system's energy efficiency, significantly surpassing traditional servers in this regard. Rust's performance optimizations contribute to the system's energy-efficient design.

Building a rack-scale system from the ground up exemplifies Oxide's innovative spirit and engineering aptitude. Their product not only meets the current demands of cloud computing but also **sets a new standard for what integrated hardware and software solutions can achieve.**

## Rust at Oxide

Oxide leverages Rust extensively in its technological stack. They have developed several Rust-based projects, including Hubris, a lightweight, memory-protected, message-passing kernel designed for deeply embedded systems. <a href="https://hubris.oxide.computer/" target="_blank">Hubris</a> stands out for its all-Rust development approach, ensuring memory safety and concurrency, key features that Rust is celebrated for.

Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer" target="_blank">Oxide's GitHub repositories</a> showcase a range of Rust projects, further illustrating their commitment to utilizing Rust in diverse aspects of their technology. These projects cover areas from <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot" target="_blank">REST API exposure</a> to <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/typify" target="_blank">JSON Schema converters</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron" target="_blank">control panel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/console" target="_blank">console</a>, highlighting the versatility and capability of Rust in different computing contexts.

## Benefits of Using Rust

The use of Rust by Oxide demonstrates the language's capability in ensuring memory safety, a critical aspect in systems programming, especially for cloud-based and embedded systems where security and robustness are paramount. By utilizing Rust, Oxide benefits from its performance, safety features, and concurrency management, which are essential for their high-performance computing products.

## Impact on Business

Oxide's innovative approach has been well received in the industry, as evidenced by their impressive list of current customers, including the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory and a notable financial services firm (I could not find the name of this firm). Their ability to deliver cloud performance across every aspect of their business without the compromises associated with traditional cloud services positions Oxide as a significant player in the enterprise IT market.

## Future Outlook

Oxide's commitment to Rust suggests a bright future for the language in enterprise-level, high-performance computing solutions. Their success serves as a testament to Rust's potential in large-scale, commercial applications, further solidifying its position as a viable choice for companies seeking robust, efficient, and secure programming solutions.

## Conclusion

Oxide Computer Company's adoption of **Rust** underscores the language's growing significance in the field of **systems programming** and cloud computing. Their success story is a beacon for other enterprises seeking innovative solutions, demonstrating the power of Rust in transforming the technological landscape of cloud computing. A company to keep an eye on!
