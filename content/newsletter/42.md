<img src="../42/webp-with-rust.webp" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; border:0">

This week, weâ€™re excited to feature a fantastic blog post by <a href="https://tduyng.dev/blog/rust-webp-transform/" target="_blank">tduyng</a>. In his post, he describes how he transformed his websiteâ€™s images to WebP format using Rust. He utilized the image crate to decode and encode images and improved the performance of his static website, generated with Zola, by significantly reducing image sizes. His Rust-based solution offers a quick and reusable way to convert various image formats to WebP, demonstrating Rustâ€™s efficiency in real-world applications. Check out his detailed guide <a href="https://tduyng.dev/blog/rust-webp-transform/" target="_blank">here</a>.

P.S. Rust Trends is also a happy user of Zola, the static site generator.
