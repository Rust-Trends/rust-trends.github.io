# Deep Dive into Reliability: Jon Gjengset‚Äôs Take on Rust‚Äôs Role in Modern Software
In a recent episode of the ‚ÄúCompose‚Äù podcast, host Tim McNamara interviews Jon Gjengset, author of Rust for Rustaceans, about enhancing software reliability.

Gjengset describes software quality as a problem ‚Äúinfinitely deep in all directions,‚Äù emphasizing the complexity of achieving reliability.

The discussion covers various testing methodologies, including fuzz testing, property testing, and concolic execution, each offering unique benefits in identifying software vulnerabilities.

They also explore tools like the Kani model checker and testing frameworks such as Loom and Turmoil, which assist in verifying concurrent Rust code.

The conversation extends to the human aspects of software development, highlighting the importance of effective collaboration with stakeholders and the sustainability of open-source projects.

Gjengset shares insights on managing dependencies, using the example of serde-yaml, to illustrate the careful consideration required when integrating external libraries.

This interview offers valuable perspectives for developers aiming to enhance the reliability of their Rust applications.

# Building a Honeypot in Rust and Deploying It to Oracle Cloud for Free
Honeypots aren‚Äôt just for catching bees‚Äîthey‚Äôre a powerful tool in cybersecurity to detect and analyze malicious activity. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to create your own honeypot while diving into some Rust programming, this tutorial is a must-read! In this guide, we‚Äôll show you how to build a honeypot in Rust and deploy it to Oracle Cloud‚Äîall without spending a dime.

## Why Rust for a Honeypot?

Rust‚Äôs reputation for performance and safety makes it an excellent choice for cybersecurity projects. A honeypot needs to handle malicious traffic gracefully (and securely). Rust‚Äôs ownership model helps ensure that even in high-stakes situations, your application won‚Äôt crash or leak sensitive data.

## What‚Äôs Inside the Tutorial?

This tutorial breaks the project into digestible steps:

 1. Crafting the Honeypot: Learn how to create a minimal yet effective honeypot in Rust. The code is beginner-friendly yet robust, making it a great project to sharpen your skills.

 2. Oracle Cloud Deployment: Why pay for hosting when Oracle Cloud offers free compute instances? The tutorial walks you through setting up your cloud environment, configuring your honeypot, and deploying it without headaches.

 3. Practical Tips: From securing your deployment to monitoring traffic, the guide offers actionable advice to ensure your honeypot operates smoothly.

## What I Loved About This Project

Building this honeypot is like solving a fun puzzle‚Äîit combines Rust‚Äôs technical edge with real-world utility. The choice to use Oracle Cloud‚Äôs free tier is brilliant, especially for those of us who love experimenting but are allergic to extra costs.

## Why You Should Try It

This isn‚Äôt just a cool project‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to level up your Rust skills, learn about cybersecurity, and deploy something tangible to the cloud. Even if you‚Äôre a Rust beginner, this guide is detailed enough to get you through. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love a good freebie?

# Building Safety with Rust: Lessons from Sonair‚Äôs Ultrasonic Sensor Development
In a recent <a href="https://www.sonair.com/journal/building-for-safety-with-rust" target="_blank">article</a>, Sonair‚Äôs Head of Software, Espen Albrektsen, delves into the company‚Äôs adoption of Rust for developing their 3D ultrasonic sensor. He highlights Rust‚Äôs blend of low-level control and high-level features, which enhances both development speed and functional safety.

Albrektsen notes that while C and C++ offer speed and flexibility, they come with legacy issues like manual memory management. Rust addresses these challenges by enforcing memory safety and providing a robust type system, leading to more reliable and secure code. He mentions that the team, initially unfamiliar with Rust, quickly became comfortable with its features, stating, __‚ÄúAlmost immediately, we were blown away.‚Äù__

A standout advantage of Rust is its ecosystem of crates‚Äîopen-source libraries that streamline development. Albrektsen shares an office joke: __‚ÄúOf course there is a crate for that,‚Äù__ emphasizing the ease of finding ready-to-use solutions for various needs.

Sonair is also pursuing safety certifications like IEC 61508 and SIL2 for their Rust-based applications, aiming to be among the first to deploy a safety-certified Rust implementation.

This journey underscores Rust‚Äôs growing significance in developing safe, efficient, and reliable embedded systems.
