The last newsletter of 2022 the next one will be published on the 1st of January 2023. Time flies when you are having fun with Rust. Let’s dive in…

__In today’s email:__

- __Enhanced Visual Studio Code__
- __ChatGPT a glimpse into the future__
- __The editor written in Rust__

## Enhanced Visual Studio Code
<div class="row"><div class="column">As a developer, you need a development environment or editor to write and debug your code. A popular editor is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>, which can be enhanced with extensions. The most downloaded Rust extension is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust" target="_blank">rust-analyzer</a>. If you want a more thorough <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust#_linting" target="_blank">static code analysis</a>, consider using `clippy` instead of the default `check` tool. While check only verifies that your code compiles, clippy analyzes your code and provides useful information and tips.

For debugging, you can use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb" target="_blank">CodeLLdb</a> extension. With this debugger, you can step through your code, put in watches, inspect variables, and see your call stack, among other features.</div><div class="column">

## ChatGPT a glimpse into the future
<div class="row"><div class="column"><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank"><img src="../7/ai-programmer.webp" alt="Copilot AI programmer" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border:0"></a></div><div class="column">ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is an artificial intelligence chatbot that is capable of performing many tasks, including writing code or refactoring existing code. You can find a <a href="https://github.com/mpociot/chatgpt-vscode" target="_blank">VSCode plugin</a> that uses ChatGPT here (note: the plugin is still a bit hacky because there is no official API for ChatGPT yet). If you would like to see a demo video on YouTube, click <a href="https://gpt3demo.com/apps/chatgpt-for-vscode" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you want to chat with GPT follow <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank">this</a> link. You will need to sign-up but it is definitively worth it.

Another AI tool that is used in production and helps you write code is <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank">Copilot</a>. They call it the AI pair programmer.

AI will be the future of in-editor resources, such as StackOverflow, as well as a pair programmer and reviewer all in one…​</div></div>


## The editor written in Rust
<div class="row"><div class="column">Are you interested in trying something new? Consider giving <a href="https://helix-editor.com/" target="_blank">Helix</a> a try – it is an editor written in Rust. To get started, watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/xHebvTGOdH8" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>. If you’d like to see the manual, click <a href="https://docs.helix-editor.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Helix is designed to be used without a mouse, keeping your hands on the keyboard. If you’re already familiar with editors like Vim, the transition to Helix should be easy.

Consider giving Helix a try in your next hobby project and let me know your experience with it.
