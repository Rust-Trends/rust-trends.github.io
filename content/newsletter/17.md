Jon Gjengset is a well-known figure in the Rust community. He is a Ph.D. candidate at MIT and has been an active contributor to the Rust programming language, particularly in the areas of distributed systems and networking. He is also a popular content creator, having produced a number of educational videos on Rust.

One of Jon’s most popular video series is called “Crust of Rust”, which is a deep-dive exploration of Rust’s standard library. In the “Crust of Rust: std::collections” video, Jon walks through the implementation of Rust’s built-in collection types, including vectors, hash maps, and more. It’s a great resource for anyone looking to gain a better understanding of how Rust’s collections work under the hood.

## Replace your shell history with Atuin
<div class="row">
<div class="column">Introducing <a href="https://github.com/ellie/atuin" target="_blank">Atuin</a>, the ultimate shell history manager written in Rust! Atuin replaces your shell history with a powerful SQLite database, allowing you to record additional context for your commands such as exit code, duration, time, and command shown. With Atuin, you can easily search your command history using a full-screen UI or filter your search by specific criteria, search for all successful `cargo build` commands, recorded after 2pm yesterday.

What’s more, Atuin offers optional and fully encrypted synchronization of your history between machines via an Atuin server, which you can host yourself or use the server provided.

And the best part? Your old history file is not replaced, so you won’t lose any of your valuable command history. With Atuin, you can access the same history across terminals, sessions, and machines and quickly jump to previous items with `Alt-<num>` or switch filter modes via `Ctrl-R`.

Try <a href="https://github.com/ellie/atuin" target="_blank">Atuin</a> today and take your command history management to the next level!</div>
