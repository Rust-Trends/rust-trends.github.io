After a successful first newsletter, hereby your second dose of Rust Trends. Feel free to reply to this email if you have ideas to share… Let’s dive into the content.

__In today’s email:__

- __Cloudflare:__ building a better internet with Rust (Speed)
- __Linux Kernel:__ Rust will be part of the Linux Kernel (Security)
- __Compiling Rust:__ speed is number one, but size also matters (Size)

## Building a better internet with Rust
<div class="row"><div class="column">Cloudflare is more than only a Content Delivery Network (CDN), that speeds up and secures your website. For their internal infrastructure, they outgrew NGINX and the programming language C. NGINX is known as one of the fastest HTTP proxies and Cloudflare decided to build their own in Rust. To optimize for speed and security on one side and development velocity on the other. Read <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet/" target="_blank">more</a> on their challenges, trade-offs, and how 5 milliseconds can make a difference. ps. Rust-Trends.com is a happy free user of Cloudflare.</div>

## Linux Kernel 6.1 will welcome Rust
<div class="row">

</div>
<div class="column">According to the original creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds: “unless something odd happens,” Rust will be part of the final Linux 6.1 release. Memory safety and removing many vulnerabilities at compile is a big plus for Rust.

## Speed and size both matter for Rust
<div class="row"><div class="column">Often Rust is mentioned for its execution speed. However, size does matter as well in Rust. The build environment cargo lets you influence the size of the final binary. Look at our example project on <a href="https://github.com/Rust-Trends/size-optimization-rust-binaries" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and read more in this <a href="https://arusahni.net/blog/2020/03/optimizing-rust-binary-size.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.

Want to learn more on this topic the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html" target="_blank">Cargo Book</a> is a valuable source of information when it comes to the building environment.</div>
