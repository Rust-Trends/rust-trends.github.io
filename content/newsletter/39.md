In a significant nod to the Rust programming language's capabilities, Tesla has incorporated Rust into its development stack for chassis controls. The role of a Full Stack Rust Software Engineer at Tesla, posted on 9th of April 2024, involves architecting and developing service backends using asynchronous Rust with Tokio, along with frontend applications utilizing frameworks like React and VueJS.

This strategic move underlines Rust's importance in creating robust, efficient software crucial for Tesla's vehicle firmware functionality validation, supporting both current and future vehicle projects. This adoption marks a noteworthy trend as major tech-oriented automotive companies leverage Rust's safety and performance benefits.

## Embarking on an Embedded Journey with Rust
<img src="../39/debugger.webp" alt="Embedded Rusty Probe" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 60%; border:0">

As I venture deeper into the world of embedded programming, I sought your input on exciting project ideas. The response was fantastic, and I've settled on a thrilling project to tackle â€” more on that in our next edition. But first, letâ€™s talk about an intriguing discovery I made while gathering your suggestions: the <a href="https://probe.rs/" target="_blank">Probe-rs project</a>.

### Introducing Probe-rs: A Rust-Based Tool for Embedded Development
In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, Rust is gaining momentum, and the embedded sector is no exception. Among the gems I discovered is Probe-rs, a powerful tool designed for embedded development, entirely written in Rust. This versatile toolkit serves as a debugger and a programmer, providing robust features for connecting with microcontrollers.

### What Makes Probe-rs Stand Out?
Probe-rs isnâ€™t just another tool; it exemplifies Rustâ€™s capability to enhance system reliability and performance. It supports a range of hardware probes, including the innovative Rusty Probe, which is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. Additionally, it's compatible with established tools like the Segger JLink, offering flexibility for various development needs.

### The Rusty Probe: A Closer Look
The <a href="https://shop.probe.rs/products/rusty-probe" target="_blank">Rusty Probe</a> represents a significant advancement in the field, leveraging the safety and efficiency of Rust. Yes the firmware of this probe is also written in Rust. Therefore this hardware probe exemplifies how Rust can be utilized to create dependable and high-performing embedded tools that are both innovative and accessible. Note that all the hardware and firmware files of this probe are freely available.

### Why Rust and Probe-rs Are Game Changers in Embedded Systems
Using Rust for embedded systems offers numerous advantages, including enhanced safety, fewer bugs, and better control over low-level system details. Rust stands out as the first higher-level language that bridges the gap between various programming disciplines â€” from web development, desktop applications to systems programming â€” allowing a broader range of developers to enter the world of embedded systems. Probe-rs harnesses these strengths, providing developers with a powerful, reliable, and easy-to-use toolset that stands out in a crowded market.

### Disclaimer and Personal Note
I want to be transparent with you all â€” I recently purchased the Rusty Probe myself. They have a delivery time of 6 - weeks from now, so I haven't had the chance to test it out yet. I also want to clarify that I am not receiving any compensation for mentioning Probe-rs or the Rusty Probe. I'm just genuinely excited about the possibilities it offers and wanted to share this tool with you. I'll definitely keep you updated on my findings once I get my hands on it and start experimenting.
