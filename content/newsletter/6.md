The Rust enthusiasm is spreading. You can get addicted to Rust. Do not take this addiction lightly. Let’s dive into the topics…

__In today’s email:__

- __The drop in vulnerabilities in Android 13__
- __A port scanner in Rust__
- __The Rust Book, now available in a crate format__

## The drop in vulnerabilities in Android 13
<div class="row"><div class="column">Google says that the number of memory safety vulnerabilities has dropped considerably over the past few years/releases. They believe Android’s ongoing shift from memory-unsafe to memory-safe languages is a major factor.

There is a strong correlation between the use of Rust and the decrease in vulnerabilities found. Note that correlation is not causation, but there is strong evidence like:

To date, there have been zero memory safety vulnerabilities discovered in Android’s Rust code.

## A port scanner in Rust
<div class="row">
<div class="column">
 <a href="https://rustscan.github.io/RustScan/" target="_blank"><img src="../6/rustscan.webp" alt="Rustscan portscanner in Rust" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border: 1"></a>
</div><div class="column">A well-known port scanner is Nmap (Network mapper). Did you know there is a (faster) Rust alternative called <a href="https://rustscan.github.io/RustScan/" target="_blank">RustScan</a>? To be fair it uses Nmap under the hood but utilizes multiple threads to speed up scanning.

The well-maintained <a href="https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan" target="_blank">repository of RustScan can be found here</a>.

You can run Rustscan also in a Docker image. This was done to make performance consistent across different Operating Systems, because of the high open file limit.

Using a Docker in your Rust development is not new. There is an official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/rust/" target="_blank">Rust image</a>.</div></div>


## The Rust Book, now available in a crate format
<div class="row"><div class="column">A funny crate and a nice way to close the Newsletter.

The Rust Book also called The Book has now I crate of its own. This book is the starting point to learn Rust. Hiro created a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thebook" target="_blank">command line utility</a> to easily access the book from your command line.
