The newsletter is growing steadily, and this is already the fourth edition of your dose of Rust Trends. Let’s dive into the content.

__In today’s email:__

- __Web Frameworks:__ make the life of a developer easier
- __Why is Rust safe:__ improve your coding habits with Rust
- __Blockchains and Rust:__ a definite match

## Web Frameworks
<div class="row"><div class="column">A web framework enables developers to build and run applications for the web without having to write all the code from scratch.

Since Rust is a system language, it has several WFs for an overview look at this <a href="https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository, and a blog post by <a href="https://kerkour.com/rust-web-framework-2022" target="_blank">Sylvain Kerkour</a>.

My favorite is <a href="https://actix.rs/" target="_blank">Actix</a>, an active community with many code examples and excellent documentation.

## Why is Rust safe?
<div class="row"><div class="column"><img src="../4/rust-a-safe-language.webp" alt="Rust a Safe Language" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; border:0"></div><div class="column">Multiple features make the Rust language Safe. A quote from the Rust Language Book “Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, so it’s important to understand how ownership works.”

Most design decisions in Rust do not leave room for interpretation, which forces good programming habits. Characteristics like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types.html">Strongly typed</a>, immutable variables by default, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank">ownership</a>, safe concurrency, etc, make <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-rust-safest-language-you-cant-use-develop-software-ken-barker/" target="_blank">Rust one of the safest languages</a> and removes possible security vulnerabilities and bugs in your code. Most of it happens at compile time, which is way better than in production at runtime.</div></div>


## Blockchains and Rust
<div class="row"><div class="column">Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin and many other decentralized digital currencies, benefits from a secure language like Rust.

There are at least five well-known blockchains using Rust as their primary language. The most popular ones are <a href="https://solana.com/" target="_blank">Solana</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.network/" target="_blank">Polkadot</a>. To see all five blockchains click <a href="https://definoobs.com/these-blockchains-use-rust-programming-language/" target="_blank">here</a>. This article refers to another great article <a href="https://definoobs.com/rust-vs-go-for-blockchain/" target="_blank">Rust vs. Go for Blockchain</a>, and highlights some nice criteria for both languages.</div>
