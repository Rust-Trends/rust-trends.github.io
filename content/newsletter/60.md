We‚Äôve got another exciting edition of Rust Trends lined up for you. This week, we‚Äôre diving into practical Rust projects like building a DNS server, exploring advanced concepts like sans I/O design with the 9p protocol, and learning how to speed up JSON decoding with the Arrow-rs library. Plus, we‚Äôve got some great community content, from astrodynamics in Rust to switching from Python to Rust insights. 

Whether you‚Äôre here for new features, project inspiration, or a dose of Rusty goodness, there‚Äôs something for everyone. Let‚Äôs jump right in!

# Building a DNS Server in Rust: Behind the Scenes
Ever wondered what it takes to build a DNS server from scratch? In collaboration with Codecrafters, <a href="https://rust-trends.com/posts/building-a-dns-server-in-rust/" target="_blank">my latest blog</a> post takes you on a deep dive into creating a DNS server using Rust. This post covers everything from parsing packets to handling requests efficiently, and if you‚Äôre up for a challenge yourself, you can try Codecrafters for free!

# Rust‚Äôs Next Ergonomic Boost: Async Closures & If/Let While Chains
This week, I stumbled upon a fascinating read: <a href="https://www.sminez.dev/socrates-is-a-state-machine/" target="_blank">‚ÄúSocrates is a state machine‚Äù</a> on Reddit. The article dives into how Rust‚Äôs async/await can be used to build a state machine for the 9p protocol, using a ‚Äúsans I/O‚Äù design.

But what does all this mean? ‚ÄúSans I/O‚Äù is all about keeping protocol logic separate from input/output operations, making your code more flexible and testable. The 9p protocol, originally from Plan 9 OS, is used for networked file systems, think of it like a messenger that helps different systems share files seamlessly.

If you‚Äôre into building modular and reusable code, this is a must-read!

# Fast Columnar JSON Decoding with Arrow-rs
If you‚Äôve ever felt the pain of slow JSON deserialization in streaming applications, this one‚Äôs for you! In their latest article, <a href="https://www.arroyo.dev/blog/fast-arrow-json-decoding" target="_blank">‚ÄúFast columnar JSON decoding‚Äù</a>, Arroyo dives into how the arrow-rs library can supercharge performance by using a columnar data format.

By decoding JSON into Arrow batches directly, arrow-rs avoids a lot of overhead, making it up to 2.3x faster than traditional row-based methods. The post also covers practical examples and benchmarks, showing where the real gains come in.

If you‚Äôre dealing with high-throughput data or just want a speed boost in your Rust applications, this is a must-read!
